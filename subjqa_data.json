I'm a cross fit / weightlifter who listens to all music, but primarily hip-hop / R&B; during workouts, running, cycling, etc. I was in a debacle trying to determine whether to get these S4s or the Bose IE2 (StayHear tips). I've heard reviews claiming that each one is better, so I initially bought the Klipsch, then decided to try the Bose. Here's what I found:PROS:- Overall the sound is great, the highs are good, mids are decent, bass is just OK --- not impressive (which is why I give it 4 stars and not 5), I'd say the sound is better than the IE2s.- Noise-cancelling - when I put these in, I don't want to hear any other sounds (e.g., the gym, other people, noise, etc), I want to be submersed in my own world. For this reason, these are way better than the Bose IE2's, which ARE NOT NOISE CANCELLING. When I tried the IE2's, I couldn't concentrate on my workout as I still heard normal noises, chatting, weights dropping, the A/C, etc. For this reason alone, I am selling my 5 day old IE2's for a loss.CONS:- Bass is not impressive, it's just decent. My old Sony's had better bass.- Although it comes with 3 sizes, the silicone is just a bit awkward and doesn't fit in my ear securely, so i sometime have to adjust it while running or doing other activities.

All the cast is extraordinary, and these great actors get their job done. Thankfully, Peter Jackson doesn't rely on visual effects heavily and his characters are not bidimensional, they are true human characters who feel the danger and the difficult task that lies ahead for them. His crew members also did their jobs right, especially the visual effects people -led by \"Star Trek: Insurrection\"'s Jim Rygiel, and Richard Taylor -who carry out their task without flooding the movie with so many effects; and Howard Shore who created his best score ever, with a little help of Enya.It would be ridiculous for me to give a summary of a story which is so wildly popular. However, I'm pretty sure that this is a great film translation of a great literary classic, which I'll get to read some time.

This just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes.The good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good. It's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft. It's a happy medium, although I do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since I can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly.The bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them. The basic taste is fine enough. It doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally I'd be OK with this since candy often labels things \"watermelon\" or \"strawberry\" when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit. Since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural, I really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate. Then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant. I can't really explain it but it's not a taste that I'd really care to have in my mouth.One thing I do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product, only 3 are organic. That doesn't bother me much, but I know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention \"organic\" but only a small part of it is actually organic. At that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non-organic product in it. (There's no USDA organic label on this anywhere, if you were wondering, which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic.) Note that this product didn't have \"made with organic ingredients\" on it, just \"made with organic sugar\". The people who label watch for organic products will know what that means. I mention all of this because I know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it.Overall I wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product. It wasn't horrible but I can safely say that I probably won't be buying any of these in the future. I might & I stress *might* try one of the other flavors, but that'd only be if the price was right.EDIT:Updated to say that I won't be buying any of this in the future. The licorice I ate later is really making me feel a little gross. Like another reviewer said, it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion. If you have a cast iron stomach (which admittedly mine isn't as strong as it once was but is still pretty good), then you probably won't have a problem with this.

I made our reservation well in advance and showed up prompt at 6:30pm. Although it was a Tuesday night the place was pretty packed. We were greeted by a lovely hostess who led us to our table on the 2nd floor. Our table was located against a grey leather banquet in the left corner. I think this had to be the best table on that level as it was far enough away from the other 2 adjacent tables and we had the whole corner to ourselves which gave us a great view of the entire floor.The menu here is predominantly mediterranean and served tapas style meant for sharing. Our waiter was really attentive all night long and each dish came out in a timely manner giving us plenty of time to enjoy one before the next course arrived. I also really enjoyed how the waiter would describe everything on plate as they delivered it to us.We started off with the Fig Salad which has to be one of the best salad i've ever had! It was so fresh with bright citrus flavours. I loved the crunch from the roasted pistachios, and the creamy salty bits of Ackawi cheese which was a nice contrast against the sweet figs. There were also notes of cardamom in the salad which was surprising to taste yet it complimented the dish so well.Next came the Lamb Ribs. I absolutely love lamb but have never had the ribs before and these were exquisite! The meat was soo tender, juicy, and flavourful and I adored the contrast of crunchy salty coating.For mains we had to have the Daily Chargrilled Fish which happened to be Red Snapper. The presentation of the snapper was really breath taking. The fish came out whole with head and tail and was nicely deboned. The fish was covered in mixture of herbs and pickled cucumbers with charred lemons on the side. This fish itself was really moist and the abundant coating of herbs gave the sweet flesh another subtle dimension of fresh flavour. For rice we went with the Oxtail Basmati Rice. I loved that the rice was topped with the crunchy fried kale and the chunks of oxtail mixed in was so tender and flavourful. Make sure you give this rice a good mix before serving so you get a little bit of everything mixed in.For a side we chose the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with Halloumi cheese. Again such a unique combination of flavours. The crispy halloumi paired so well with the roasted brussel sprouts drizzled with the creamy yogurt sauce we couldn't get enough of them!Although I was stuffed at this point I couldn't resist trying some some there enticing desserts.The Chocolate Mousse was soo creamy and light and not too sweet. I loved the bits of broken baklava to add some crunch and spots of chocolate sauce on plate to intensify the chocolate flavour.Burnt Honey Ice cream had a wonderful roasted honey flavourful with notes of vanilla and topped with a wedge of sponge toffee on top.Turkish Coffee Ice cream was soo creamy and rich with a chocolate base and notes coffee in the background topped with chocolate shavingsFinally I had a Moroccan Mint Tea to wash it all down which had a mild mint flavour served in glass tumbler piping hot with mint leaves floating on top was the perfect way to end a glorious meal.I can totally see why people are flocking here. This meal will definitely go down in one of my top 10 most memorable meals! The service here is top notch and the flavours are so unique and amazing.

The mint, to me, overpowers any hint of tomato.Spinach Chive: Kind of a neutral taste - not heavy on the chive side and more like green tea with a hint of chive.Fennel Spice: I love fennel and this one was probably my favorite.

I ordered the DVD set on a lark. I have always like Science Fiction and have looked for film/video adaptations. I have usually been disappointed but I keep trying. Finding a gem like this one makes the effort worth while.The basic premise is of the crew of a tramp freighter who make their way by carrying freights, the occasional smuggling job and a few other less than legal operation. These are invariably conducted against people who deserve to have been on the losing side. The captain and first mate are old war buddies. They were both on the losing side of a civil war. The mate is married to the ships pilot. The ship's engineer is a sweet, somewhat nave and technically competent young lady. A tough, mercenary type rounds out the regular crew.In the first episode, they take on a series of passengers. One of them is a \"shepherd\", which is a sort of itinerant Christian priest. He has a mysterious past we never really learn about. A brother and sister also come on board. The brother is a highly skilled surgeon and the sister is a genius who had secret experiments run on her by government agents. They are on the run from the same government agents. The other \"permanent\" passenger is a courtesan. She leases one of the ship's shuttles as her place of business. While the crew is doing their thing, she does hers.Much of this series seems like a cowboy picture, right down to the horses, saloons and brothels. In a strange way, it works well in the context of the series. It is well done. I am very sorry that the series was cancelled because it is very good.Synopses of the episodes appear below:Serenity - the crew of the Serenity agrees to pick up a less than legal cargo but gets stiffed on their fee when they try to deliver it. Unless they can find somewhere to sell it, they won't have the cash for parts, fuel, salary or anything else. So they try to less it on some border areas. To help pay the way, they take on some passengers also. One of the passengers turns out to be smuggling a fugitive and another is a federal agent sent to bring in everyone. I get the impression that the government types are not very nice. When you throw in a courtesan, some cannibals and a preacher, things get interesting.The Train Job - This one seems more like a western but doesn't suffer from that. The crew is hired to rob a train on a frontier planet. The goods they are hired to purloin belong to the Federation government so no one really minds or things it is \"wrong\". They also enjoy doing the job right under the noses of Federation troops. The crew doesn't really know what they are stealing. It is only when the train gets to it destination that they learn that they have stolen desperately needed medical supplies. The leads the crew to try to return the goods without getting caught by the feds or the crime boss they were doing job for. This is to be done while the crew is still be pursued by the secret government agency from whom one of the passengers escaped. It's a good and exciting episode.Bushwhacked - While doing nothing in particular, the crew of the Serenity encounter a derelict floating in space. When they go aboard, they find that the crew has been slaughtered by the Reevers (cannibal lunatics) mentioned in the first episode. They left one survivor and a valuable cargo. The crew attempts to help the survivor and salvage the cargo but their efforts are interrupted by a Federation ship. The captain of that ship assumes that it is the crew of the Serenity who committed the atrocities. The crew have to protect themselves, establish their innocence and hide the fugitives who have become passengers.Shindig - The crew returns to the planet Persephone, where the series started. They are looking for business opportunities as usual and a possibility pops up. The captain sees an opportunity for a smuggling run and goes to make contact at a fancy party hosted by the local gentry. To keep this episode interesting, Innarra, the staff courtesan has a date with a local bigwig. He and the captain have a bit of a tiff and wind up in a duel...with swords. There is not a lot of call for swords on spaceships.Safe - In seems that nothing can go right. The crew of the Serenity make planetfall with the consignment of cattle they picked up in the last episode and are about to collect their payment. Then things go wrong as they inevitably must. The local law shows up to arrest the cattle buyers just as the money is changing hands and the crew get involved in the shootout. They help out the law but the parson gets himself shot...very seriously shot. The only two missing from the scene are the two fugitives who have wandered off. The captain thinks they might get in the way of the deal making but now the doctor's services are needed. Unfortunately, he and his sister have gotten themselves kidnapped by some religious types who live in the hills. They are glad to have the doctor but they think the sister is a witch and must burn. Saving the preacher and rescuing the siblings proves to be a sticky situation.Our Mrs. Reynolds - Somehow, we don't really know how, the crew of the Serenity find themselves helping a rural community defend themselves from bandits. After the big celebration, the crew get back on board take of and find that they have an extra passenger. It seems that, according to the local customs, the captain has gotten himself married. That is news to everyone. The young girl is seemingly nave but she is not what she seems. Someone wants the Serenity for scrap.Jaynestown - Jayne Cobb is perhaps the least likeable member of the Serenity crew. He is selfish, not too bright and always ready to fight. He has a long history of leaving planets behind while being on the run. In this episode, the crew sets down to pick up an illicit cargo and Jayne is worried because he knows he left the place on the run. He adopts a disguise. Much to everyone's surprise, everyone learns that Jayne Cobb has become a folk hero to the people on the planet complete with a statue in the public square. All of this came about because of a misunderstanding. He never intended to help those people; he did it by accident but he is still a hero. Heroes have people who don't like them and on this planet that include the local magistrate.Out of Gas - Most series wait until at least the second season before having a retrospective episode. This one takes place halfway through the first season but it has a difference. Instead of recycling footage from old episodes this one has all new footage. The situation involves a serious mechanical failure while the ship is in transit. Life support is failing and the captain sends his crew off in the two shuttles while he stays aboard to try and fix things. While this is going on, we are treated to flashback showing how the crew came to be assembled.Ariel - When the mysterious female passenger with mental problems starts getting worse, her brother the doctor comes up with a seemingly simple scheme to serve everyone's needs. The crew is to help the doc smuggle sis into a hospital for some tests and the doc agrees to help them steal some high dollar drugs to sell on the fringe planets. These are not recreational pharmaceuticals but vital medicines in short supply. The plan seems to work smoothly until treachery becomes apparent.War Stories - In the second episode, the crew is hired to pull a train heist. They pull it off but, when all is said and done, they find that they don't want to keep the goods. The natives need the stolen medications more than the crew needs the money. This is all good and noble and such but it hacks of the crime boss who put them up to it. The crew returned the money but the boss wants revenge. In this episode, he manages to capture the captain and the pilot. It is up to the rest of the crew to get them out.Trash - A few episodes back, the captain got himself accidentally married. The blushing bride turned out to be a con woman and they only barely got away with their lives and their ship. This time, at a Smuggler rendezvous, the captain runs into an old war buddy who happens to have gotten himself married to the same piece of trash. When the story comes out, the wife gets stranded. Captain Mal is about to strand her as well but she manages to talk him into one of her schemes. Naturally, the \"lady\" has an angle of her own. Make that lots of angles...and curves...and treachery. The crew has a few ideas of their own but nothing is going to go as planned.The Message - When the crew stops at a station for a mail call, they get a surprise. A corpse has been mailed to the captain and Zo. The corpse turns out to be an old war buddy. His last request is that the Serenity take him home for burial. Things are not as they seem, however. The corpse is not dead. Instead, he is smuggling body parts and there are other who want the parts, without the rest of the body. As everyone turns on everyone else over conflicting loyalties, the situation gets tense.Heart of Gold - When Inarra, the courtesan, gets a distress call, she talks the crew of Serenity into helping an old friend of hers who is the madam of a bordello on a backwater planet. A local powerbroker with a barren wife want to sire an heir on one of the house girls. He manages to plant his crop and intends to claim it by force. The crew intend to prevent that. And a good time is had by most.Objects in Space - River, the female fugitive, continues to get more and more erratic. This troubles the crew who fear not only for themselves but for her as well. Things are not helped in that there is a very large reward for her capture. This tends to promote suspicion with many of the people with which they deal. In this episode, a bounty hunter manages to sneak aboard and waylay the crew one by one. River, though, is not without her own methods.", "domain": "movies", "id": "ab79cc8432d6617f261ccd27ded849d6", "is_ques_subjective": true, "nn_asp": "history", "nn_mod": "long", "q_reviews_id": "d97ebb2d7f9db597356f7b87f2fb420e", "query_asp": "dialogue", "query_mod": "good", "ques_subj_score": 0.6000000238418579, "question": "Do you think a movie with good dialogue?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "b3ef87bff9be1447a69283537ea493a2", "title": "B0000AQS0F", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [283, 0], "text": ["Room was in good shape", "Had a corner room"]}, "context": "Had a corner room, high up, with a nice view of the city.

One of best books of 2012!Hopeless utterly blew me away. It was the kind of book that makes me want to stand on a rooftop and shout how amazing it is to the whole world! Beautiful, heart-wrenching and uplifting.Colleen Hoover's writing is absorbing, captivating, and flows so smoothly you barely feel the pages slipping by.After just reading the prologue, I. Was. Hooked. and I just knew that I had to put my life on hold until I finished it. It gives you a taste of where the story is headed and just grabs at your heart in a way that makes you just NEED to know more.When Sky meets Holder, her life changes. He is the first guy to make her heart skip a beat. The first guy to really make her FEEL.\"I've never been swept off my feet. I don't get butterflies. In fact the whole idea of being swooned by anyone is foreign to me... Somehow, in the course of sixty seconds, this guy has managed to swoon me, then terrify the hell out of me.\"Dean Holder was absolutely amazing. With just a touch of bad boy, lickable dimples, a crooked smile and a tattoo, this moody, mysterious and endearing hot guy with a temper just utterly stole my heart.\"I saw a guy at the store after school, and holy s***, Six. He was beautiful. Scary, but beautiful....as soon as I looked at him, it was like my entire body melted to the floor. He was... Wow.\"Deeply protective and totally swoony but with a bad rep, he was so contradictory - warm, cold. Sweet, sharp. Just like Sky, I just NEEDED to know more about him. And the more I learned, the more the mystery deepened.I loved watching them get closer and closer. Their chemistry was undeniable and their dialogue and banter was rapid fire and brilliant and just set my heart a flutter.What they had was intense, passionate, and oh-so REAL. Every single thing they went though and did was believable and just made you wish you knew them in person.I loved that the story was serious but little parts made me laugh out, breaking up the more emotionally charged scenes. I swooned, squeed, proclaimed my undying love for the book, and had to take breathers to wipe the tears that sprung up on me more than once.I felt so in sync with Sky's emotions and journey. I felt like I went through all her emotions without ever once feeling disconnected. Through her eyes, I fell in love with Holder, I felt her pain and confusion, and I felt her healing. She was a wonderfully strong, brave heroine - the kind you want to look up to and make you feel proud of.This book has the. most. beautiful. intense. breathtaking. first kiss. EVER. (without actually kissing). Curious? You'll have to read it and see. But I am not kidding, it was one of the best written kisses I've ever read!I loved that the story was emotionally charged but with absolutely no stupidity. All the characters' reactions were understandable and just made me more and more sympathetic to them. This isn't to say that there wasn't angst and heart-clutching turmoil, because there was. The subject matter and themes are serious, gut wrenching and very mature. This book is definitely 17+.\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.\"I have to say that I didn't see the big reveal coming. I had my suspicions about one part of the story, but the other part totally took me by surprise.All the pieces of the story just build and build, layer upon layer of things you don't even realize are important until the secrets come out and the cascade of emotions from them just crash into you and take your breath away.\"Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\"This is a quite simply a beautiful story about love and survival. About hope and healing. About life and death. About coping with tragedy and finding forgiveness and peace. About being strong. About being a victim, but also a survivor.I honestly do not have one single complaint about this book. I have entire pages of my copy highlighted. Its THAT good.Every word, every sentence, every scene puts the imagery of the story into your head so vividly that you feel as though you are right there, watching the events unfold.This book NEEDS to be made into a movie!!This is one of those stories that will stay with you forever.And yes, there is a HEA :)\"F**k all the firsts, Sky.

The pancakes from this mix are better than a wheat-based pancake. I modify the recipe a little bit because I like to use buttermilk instead of the water called for on the box. Also, I have to use a lot more liquid as this mix really soaks up the liquid and can be too stiff using the same amount of liquid as the dry mix. . Basically, you mix eggs,oil, and buttermilk with the mix and voila - great pancakes. I use it as a thickener - like when I make a cobbler and my fruit is runny - a tablespoon or two in the fruit and it sets up nicely when baking. I also use it with oats in the topping of my crisp. A tablespoon or two with the oats along with brown sugar and butter makes a nice topping. When making muffins, if the recipe calls for 2 cups of flour, I use 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of this mix and my muffins turn out great and have great flavor.I now order the 4-package deal that Amazon has.

Being a true take on the then new Dark Knight series of comics that treated its readers to a more mature and brooding Batman, giving them strong, well thought out stories with a more adult theme. This was (in my opinion) due to the influence of the up and coming Manga trend surfacing in the west with the hugely popular Akira film. Burton and Keaton created, on the screen, a Dark hero for the 90's that the fans of the comics could relate to and it worked BIG time marrying stark visuals with a music score as rich as you could fit on any film. For a home cinema owner there is little better out there to show off your systems capability than with than this film. As with most sequels the second, Batman Returns, was less than the original, in this case suffering from too many characters/stars all demanding a piece of the screen time, why on earth the studios think that more is better is beyond me. Quality is ALWAYS better than quantity in a film as born out in many sequels vs. originals. That is not to say that this was a poor film, far from it, just not as good as the first. There were too many character origins to make the main plot anything other than passable. Now, onto the third in the series. A new director will always bring with them a new vision of a character and story and Schumacher is no different, I believe another reviewer had the same thoughts as me on this one 'The Dark Knight in Technicolor'. For fans of the first two films this had to be a bit of a shock, new Batman and a real glossy comic book feel to the film. This was good escapism but lacked the mature approach of the first two films. Oh dear, with the final outing, Batman Forever, we see where Schumacher got his inspiration, not from the comics, not from the first films, oh no, anyone remember the campy, hammy Batman TV series with Burt Ward I believe?? Yup the only thing missing from this film were tights and the visual sound affects. POW BASH KA-BLAMMY. I strongly feel that the stars were wasted on this film, which is a great pity as there is far more potential to this series than has been shown thus far.

Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't. The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem. I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long. This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name. I am rating the coffee three stars instead of less because if the purchaser always uses cream in their coffee, many of the taste issues I encountered should be if not resolved, at least mitigated.", "domain": "grocery", "id": "028d33aca482fa7fb2ca0fd5c9a4f5c6", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "coffee", "nn_mod": "bitter", "q_reviews_id": "3675099150ecaa02af0ceb93e43c691f", "query_asp": "coffee", "query_mod": "delicious", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the coffee?", "question_subj_level": 3, "review_id": "7784494ba5ebb4a346060d0e2098835d", "title": "B002D4DY8G", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "The food was amazing!!!

Prometheus is a prequel of sorts detailing events that may have set the story of Alien in motion and created it's iconic creatures. So why at the climax are we so unsatisfied by what we just saw? As with all Scott's films Prometheus is a gorgeously designed and filmed movie but, despite the interesting set up about the possible origins of man and the existence of other superior beings, the visuals are a just an empty candy coating as the film goes nowhere with these ideas. We get a story about Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Repace) who discovers numerous occurances of a hieroglyphic throughout various earth times and cultures which she interprets as an invitation from a extraterrestrial race. Enter the Weyland Corporation (The villainous \"Company\" from the Alien films) who fund an expedition but, apparently with there own agenda. And the Prometheus is off to investigate with it's cliche' corporate villain captain (Charlize Theron, who really doesn't do much but be a company bitch) and the usual suspicious android, David (Michael Fassbender who has the best role). And here lies the problem, we start out expecting to find something fascinating and Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts' script gives us a cliche' story of extraterrestrials whose intentions aren't as noble as first believed and slimy corporate villains who want to use what they find for there own nefarious purposes. Sorry, been there, done that. Seen it all before. The beings true purpose in their genetic tampering is never revealed nor does it make sense to leave evidence of their existence on earth when they are ultimately up to no good. Prometheus leaves the most interesting questions unanswered and instead moves the plot along by having characters do the stupidest things... seriously, genius scientists taking their helmets off in an alien environment without any clue that there might be an undetected threat?... Are you kidding me?... I'll admit there are a few tense scenes, althought the film is rather laid back pace wise, and could have used a lot more suspense and energy if it wasn't going to get overly interesting with it' story. And most aggrevating of all, is that the film is open ended. It doesn't even give us a satisfying conclusion. It leaves the most important questions unanswered and implies we have to wait for yet another film to find out how this story ends and how it links to the begining of Alien, which it eventually will.

Verhoeven and screenwriters Michael Miner and Edward Neumeier surely had the ability to see into the future, as the world they envisioned has, in many ways, come true.Old Detroit, the near future. The city is terrorized by a gang of thugs, headed by Clarence Boddicer (&quot;That 70's Show&quot; Kurtwood Smith) and his men. The city has decided to turn over the operation of the police department to the OCP corporation.Enter cop Alex Murphy (Peter Weller), freshly transferred to the Old Detroit police department. Partnered with Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen), Murphy and Lewis hit the streets.An encounter with Boddicer and his boys leaves Murphy, well, dead. Enter smarmy OCP executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), who has been developing a program to create a cyborg cop. Murphy becomes his guinea pig and &quot;Robocop&quot; is born.Much of the social satire and humor Verhoeven interjects into the movies comes in the form of in-movie television broadcasts, the sort of which are common now, on CNN, MSNBC and the like. Smiling reporters dish out daily doses of sex and violence to the masses.The story is essentially the robot Murphy's regaining of his humanity. His creators erase his memory, or so they think, until Murphy begins to experience flashbacks from his former life, including memories of his death, which leads him on a search to avenge his death. His search takes him back to OCP as he confronts the man who was responsible for his death.As submitted to the MPAA, &quot;Robocop&quot; was going to be awarded with the dreaded &quot;X&quot; rating for violence. The Criterion Collection release of &quot;Robocop&quot; restores Verhoeven's original vision, which is a few seconds here and there of blood and gore. While the film is indeed violent, the bloodshed is certainly tame by today's standards -- Verhoeven's &quot;Starship Troopers,&quot; released in 1997, is much bloodier and violent than &quot;Robocop&quot; and it received an &quot;R&quot; rating.The transfer, while non-anamorphic, is still very good; the film is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen. There are two audio tracks, a Dolby Digital 2.0 track and commentary track. The commentary is lifted from the laserdisc edition of &quot;Robocop,&quot; and is an entertaining discussion with Verhoeven, his writers, and others involved in the production.Until &quot;Robocop&quot; gets the special edition DVD treatment, this Criterion version is worth hunting down. &quot;I'd buy that for a dollar!&quot;", "domain": "movies", "id": "40424bf2502e9c91604556a542d3fe7f", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "transfer", "nn_mod": "good", "q_reviews_id": "a372f11d03e9870077b555f1e16775e7", "query_asp": "film", "query_mod": "old", "ques_subj_score": 0.20000000298023224, "question": "How old is the film?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "9e8b78ab550f2e8fc6c4b38324faaf43", "title": "0792845730", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [90, 148], "text": ["The individual performances by the actors were stellar in every way", "every way"]}, "context": "I've seen the stage play and found the movie version very moving and quite wonderful too.

We were seated upstairs and that has a different atmosphere than the downstairs space. It is a more cozy and intimate. Tried the echo cocktail and that was delicious. Wine selection spectacular. Server was knowledgeable about wine selection and attentive. Only problem watch out for the low hanging lights at your table when getting up. I hit my head twice fairly hard.

First, the positives: the room was clean and the Heavenly Bed was as great as always! The lobby is lovely, and I love the way the hotel has leveraged its marvelous history by providing so many vintage pictures of its past glory days entertaining kings and presidents.The negatives, however, far outweighed the positives (at least on this visit):* Check-in was excruciatingly slow, even though we checked in at about 11 pm, with only one person in line in front of us. There were three people available to check guests in, but none was very efficient.* The coffee maker in our room was defective. When I called &quot;Service First&quot; to request a new one, the representative gave me the 5th degree on whether I'd properly operated the one in the room. We never did get a replacement, and decided to go to the Starbucks down the block instead.* There was paint peeling from the wall in the bathroom in about a 2 square foot area.* Even though I am a Starwood Gold Preferred Guest, we did not receive turndown service or a newspaper during our two nights at the St. Francis.* Our room had no hotel directory in the black portfolio provided in the room. Again, I contacted Service First to request one. It never came.I've stayed at the St. Francis five or six times in the past 5 years and--until now--have always had a very pleasant experience.

Remington \"Riptide\" Tate was quickly on his way to becoming my new book boyfriend before I even got through chapter one. What I didn't expect was for the journey Katy Evan took me on with this book. I had no clue what Brooke Dumas was getting into when she decided to accept a job for the one and only Remy!After having her dreams crushed Brooke has decided to take her life on a new path beginning with a new career. Her new path leads her right into the hotel room of Remington Tate and soon signing a contract to work for him for the next three months. What she did not expect was the unexpected feelings that she would have for him or the emotional roller coaster that she needed to strap in for. Remington has strong mood swings and he knows he has finally found the one in Brooke, but he is scared that his disease will make him hurt Brooke and she is the one he is willing to fight the hardest for!*Brooke: \"I know they're worried this will end badly. I'm Remington's employee and only a temporary one, and he has a bad reputation with tons of evidence behind it. He obviously has a little bit of a temper and can prove to be too hot to handle. But even though he's so strong, I know instinctively that he'd never hurt me, and he's never done anything to demonstrate otherwise. The rest doesn't matter right now. It just doesn't matter to me at all. I want him. With a force I haven't felt in over six years. And I'm going to go for it.\"As Brooke starts to peel the layers back and sees not only Remington's beautiful blue eyes but also his black eyes she starts to realize that their love maybe one of the most complicated things in her life but it's something she won't walk away from. Right in the middle of this love affair Brooke gets herself into a difficult situation while trying to save her sister from a life she isn't supposed to be in. Will she be able to save her while also protecting Remington? When things finally start to go right with Brooke and Remington everything comes crashing down. Remington's only fear is too loose Brooke but after many promises to be his will she walk away and leave him like everyone else in his life has done including his parents?*Brooke: \"You are the most beautifully complicated, gentle fighter I've ever known.\" \"But I can't stay anymore, Remy. I can't watch you hurt yourself, because when you do, you're hurting me in ways I never thought anybody could hurt me, and I'm afraid of breaking and never being right again.\"I personally loved this book. After dealing with a family member with Bipolar for the past 11 years I connected with this book in many ways. Seeing how scared Remington was of hurting his loved ones and even worse knowing how afraid he was that he wouldn't remember anything that he had done. Then watching how Brooke had to figure out how to handle Remington, knowing she would never know what kind of mood he was in, she truly became his anchor.

However, wanting them to form their own conclusion along with my kids & theirs (who had no idea I HATED THIS), we watched it. I kept my mouth shut the entire movie. My brother, sister in law, neices/nephews & my kids, along with 3 of the kids friends thought this was awful. The entire movie, all they did was rag on it & say it was 'STUPID' the entire flick. 'STUPID' was an adjective I used but never mentioned so I got quite a laugh hearing adults & 7 kids all use the same adjective, along with many more non flattering ones. & sorry to say, it was just as AWFUL watching it the 2nd time as it was the 1st. What really threw me was this is supposed to be a G rated 'family' flick, & I guess in theory it certainly is.....But needless to say us adults were quite off guard when the KIDS starting making comments about how the characters ALL LOOK STONED...Yep...KIDS made these comments!Anyway, just thought id edit this & add the above as not 1 of us liked this flick & ALL OF US thought it was HORRIBLE/STUPID...pick your most unflattering adjective & add it in....Even ALL the kids hated this.I know with movies everybody has different tastes but every now & then you see a flick leaving you wondering how anybody could have liked it. This is it!!! Again, I know everybody has different tastes & I respect the fact some liked or even loved this flick...but it still leaves me wondering how anybody could like this stupid tripe.

Saw the reviews here which were pretty gapping. Not many 'in the middle'. Most are either 5 star or 1 star, meaning most either loved or hated it.Put me in the hated it camp.Yes, I forced myself to watch it & although I kept wanting to turn it off, I gave in & watched it all.I wont say this is the worst movie I ever watched but its high on the list.This flick was simply one of the most absurdly boring & 'stupid' flicks I have ever seen. While I fully understand everybody has different tastes, im still a bit shocked that anybody actually liked this ridiculous tripe.But please, watch it for yourself & form your own conclusion, as I did.But yep, If I tried listing everything I HATED about this flick, I'd be typing for hours.

I eat some in my morning Oatmeal, and I always make it a point to get the Diet Coke with Splenda in it, rather than the aspartame stuff.I have been getting the fiber splenda. One gram of fiber per packet didn't seem to be much, but it was something to make the sweetener less empty, and it eliminated the gram of dextrose used to stretch the Splenda to make it measure. You occasionally see the tablets of Splenda, but they are rare, and they don't work on oatmeal.So I asked my wife, \"Please surprise me by switching to the Splenda Essentials with Antioxidants some morning over the next week.\" She agreed. On the third morning, I noted an odd taste in my cereal. Not unpleasant, just odd.I asked her, and she confirmed, that was the first morning she had used the Antioxidant Splenda.So, unlike the fiber splenda, the antioxidant Splenda has a taste.Now, I normally only put sweetener in my coffee if it is nasty tasting. But I don't have any nasty tasting coffee, so I put the antioxidant Splenda sweetener into regular coffee just to see if I can taste it.I am pretty sure I can taste it, but it is not a blind taste test. I am going by what I taste in my oatmeal.As I've said, the taste is minor and not unpleasant. It is hard to detect when I put one packet into 8 ounces of coffee.My opinion is that Splenda is the best artificial sweetener on the market. The worst tasting is aspartame, then stevia because of the odd licorice overtone. Then saccharine, and that only when a small amount of saccarine is used. I used to make ice tea with a half gallon of strong tea and one saccharine, and at that ratio, it was not bad. It took the bitter edge off of the tea.If you can get cyclamates, they go here, and then, at the top, Splenda. Nothing tastes like sugar, especially not corn syrup, but splenda has the most neutral sweet taste of the artificials. Now that it is available, I try not to use any of the other artificials, and I am not supposed to consume a lot of sugar.So plain splenda would get five stars as an artificial sweetener. Essentials with fiber would get the same score. Antioxidant gets 4 stars because it has an off taste that is not a bad taste and because it is detectable other than sweetener. I believe that even with this off taste it tastes better than saccharine. So it loses one star for the detectable taste, but not more.This sweetener comes in a heavy, stiff, hard to tear bag, that could probably survive being kept in a wallet in the rain without damage, and the bag is stiff and strong enough that someone with bad arthritis might not want or be able to use the sweetener in the bag.", "domain": "grocery", "id": "d7e14be3c16a5983b010640eec312410", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "taste", "nn_mod": "unpleasant", "q_reviews_id": "e32c78fcb0fb0c0227d2eb22322c4d23", "query_asp": "aftertaste", "query_mod": "strange", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the aftertaste?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "3c4818c930a88545bd91c5217e9ea13e", "title": "B004OQ257C", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [159, 159], "text": ["Service is good", "Service is good"]}, "context": "There's no line up when I go for lunch on wed, there're still seats available.

Yet again, we`re in the middle of a trilogy.Ten years has passed since the events of \"Star Wars Episode I - The Phantom Menace\". Anakin is now a 19 year old Jedi padawan, and Amidala has left her position as the queen of Naboo to serve the senate. We`re also facing a cooler, less annoying Jar-Jar Binks (but don`t worry. He`s just on screen for 5-10 minutes!). Obi-Wan Kenobi is the same person as always, a worried man with a tough sense of humour. The Republic is still in crisis. Many solar systems is trying to separate from the republic. Under the lead of the mysterious count Dooku (yeah, right , COUNT Dooku, played by legendary horror veteran Christopher Lee), the separatists plan to kill senator Amidala. Anakin and Obi Wan are now sent out by the Jedi council to protect her, and this leads into many fearsome events, especially as Anakin is more and more on his way to the Dark Side.I think that \"Attack of The Clones\" is a lot better than \"The Phantom Menace\". After having seen the first film I was worried. I was thinking \"Well, it`s Ok to have one bad Star Wars film. But if the second appears to be [bad], I don`t think the prequel trilogy will ever reach up to the standards of the old one\"Fortunatley, Lucas hasn`t written the script himself this time. He`s co-written it with Jonathan Hales (who also wrote the action flick \"The Scorpion King\"). This film is more in the spirit of the original trilogy than \"The Phantom Menace\", and it`s full of memorable action sequences and has lots of fun lines, which comes close to \"The Empire Strikes Back\" which is may be the best Star Wars film in my opinion.This movie is much more matured and serious than \"The Phantom Menace\" - for example, there is much more love and serious drama this time.This could very well be the darkest and most serious Star Wars movie so far.Finally, we are also given the answers of questions that has previously been hidden. For example - why don`t the jedi discover the dark lord of the sith is controlling the republic, what did the Storm Troopers came from and how did Anakin`s enormous hate really began?While the last movie felt more like an adventure film, this one feels more like a typical Star Wars movie.I also think that the actors are well chosen - the newcomer Hayden Christensen is excellent as the grown-up Anakin Skywalker (while Jake Lloyd [was not]!)In fact, he`s one of the best actors since Harrison Ford to appear in a Star Wars film!Ewan McGregor is great as the always skeptical and carefull Obi-Wan Kenobi and Christopher Lee is a fun surprise as the new villain ( I think this is funny : he`s playing a real bad guy in both Star Wars II and Lord of the Rings II this year!) and Samuel L. Jackson swings his lightsaber with the same coolness as when he played \"Shaft\".Something which I have noticed recently is that the Star Wars characters never changes. They always have the same personality. This is making a typical film analysis of Star Wars impossible!Anyhow, this isn`t the best Star Wars movie out there. I think that there is simply TOO MUCH action to make it as memorable as the original trilogy.The 30-minute final battle sequence sometimes seems more like marketing for action figures than a real movie!And the sequence where Yoda swings his lightsaber for the first time is fun, but it`s sometimes feels made just for the fans to have someone laughing at. To sum it up : the action sequences are too many and too long!They should have taken even more feelsome and serious moments and cut away may be 15 minutes or so of the action sequences.But except for that, I`m actually quite happy with this movie. This movie simply brings us a new hope for the Star Wars saga - Lucas is definitly on the right way, but he`s not really there yet. It feels like a pity you have to wait for another three years to see what the final chapter of the saga is like. I hope Lucas is taking all of his best ideas and use them to give us the greatest film ever made with Episode III!!", "domain": "movies", "id": "6c5cc8dafa5fa434a3ce300ee6ba4cee", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "film", "nn_mod": "more", "q_reviews_id": "7e04239730722a07c3c1188c654313d7", "query_asp": "story", "query_mod": "dull", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the story?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "cd7859cbecc094a44189f14fe7f5bae4", "title": "B0000633ZP", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "I red this book that I had been anticipating for some time with a mixture of excitement and drowsiness, which I guess comes of making a wal-mart run at midnight and reading until 4 A.M. then starting again 6 hours later.

Every year, to remind the districts they are the \"losers\" in the war, the Capital stages \"The Hunger Games.\" Districts select tributes to represent them. The tributes must kill each other in a game arena to win.When Katniss Everdeen's sister, Prim, is selected to represent District 12, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Along with Peeta Mellark, Katniss travels to the Capital. As she prepares to participate in the games, she realizes there is more to the games than skill. She must learn the art of subtlety and draw on all her wits to keep alive. Can Katniss win \"The Hunger Games?\"Collins' writing is crisp and sharp. She never lingers - the pacing is perfect. Her descriptions are just enough to paint vivid pictures in the reader's mind. Collins' creativity and imagination shine in this story as she gives us a dystopian look at the future, and while the future may look bleak, she also leaves us with a smidgen of hope.The best part of the novel is the journey Katniss makes. When the reader meets her, they learn she is physically strong, but it's the emotional journey that allows her to grow. Katniss' heart is as tough as nails, but to survive, she must show a tender side. She must demonstrate she cares for Peeta or she will lose. Can Katniss allow herself to explore the vulnerabilities of the human heart while playing the most dangerous game of her life?The book is mainstream fiction and appeals to readers 10 and up.

Maybe this was why we were offered an upgrade? In the evenings we were able to walk the neighborhood unmolested and gawk at the mansions in the 'hood- we probably got the police called on us as we ogled from the sidewalk (hey- they light those homes so you WILL ogle!). We were able to walk to the Fillmore district for dinner one night so it isn't totally far from restaurants, but you WILL burn off the calories from dinner. We also walked down to the waterfront area down the Lyon Street steps and caught the cable car over to Union Square for dinner and a pint at Johnny Foleys. One weird thing about parking at the hotel is that the parking is street parking and therefore under the parking laws- it must be moved every three hours after 9 in the morning.

It would become a financial disaster or a goldmine. And sure enough, \"Avatar\" has become the latter. The film has grossed over $2.7 billion and with this Blu-ray and DVD release, during the first two days of its sale, it has sold over $5 million copies.Needless to say, this is the easily James Cameron's masterpiece. Avoiding anything that resembles sci-fi kitsch with the use of its CG and becoming just eye candy, \"Avatar\" is a fantastic film that deserves to be seen and this is coming from a reviewer who was more than caustic towards this film before reviewing this Blu-ray release.VIDEO:\"Avatar\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:78:1) and is the true definition of reference quality video. Detail and colors are just amazing. The close up of the CG work looks so realistic and are so remarkably detailed that it looks as if Cameron and crew have achieved CG perfection. You see skin pores, the application of the pain on the skin, the sweat glistening on the characters. How do they do that? There is amazing detail in land of Pandora as each step and each touch produces this light around a plant or surrounding and the colors just glow and look fantastic in HD.And it just doesn't stop there. There is detail everywhere. From the mecha vehicles that Spec-Ops command, the large vehicle units, the creatures on Pandora are shown with a large assortment of colors.This is the best looking film on Blu-ray that has come since the first release of Blu-ray discs. I know this is a statement that is hard to believe especially with so many fantastic reference quality releases on BD but \"Avatar\" has set the bar up high of how gorgeous a film can look on Blu-ray. Incredible!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:\"Avatar\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English Dolby Surround, English Decruption Audio, Spanish, French and Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital. And you think that \"Avatar\" has raised the bar for picture quality, the audio for \"Avatar\" is equally fantastic!Immersive. This is the word I describe this film as the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless audio track takes control of your soundscape and sound is coming from the front and center channels, surround channels are active throughout the film. May it be the forest ambiance, creatures rustling in the leaves, large animals heard flying above and of course, the pulse-pound action as the LFE is fully engaged. Expect your subwoofer (and literally all channels) to go on over-drive as the film, especially during the second half of \"Avatar\" makes those scenes come alive. The vehicles flying and the rotors blowing the trees, missiles firing and causing destruction and trees falling everywhere and the scream of the Omaticaya's as they are losing their home.Again... Incredible!As for subtitles, \"Avatar\" is presented in English SDH, Spanish and Portuguese.SPECIAL FEATURES:\"Avatar\" does not come with any special features but more than likely we will see a ultimate edition coming out later this year.EXTRAS:\"Avatar\" comes with a slipcase and a DVD version of the film. The DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1, English, Spanish and French Dolby Surround.JUDGMENT CALL:When \"Avatar\" was released in theaters, I admit that I took a caustic approach to the film.It's not that dislike James Cameron films because I have enjoyed many of his films but it deals with my feelings of technology and films infused by CG that the more I see a sci-fi film utilizing it to the nth degree, I look at these films as becoming kitsch. Granted, I'm not expecting the return of thousands of talents and epic filmmaking along the reigns of D.W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" but when I saw the trailer for \"Avatar\", I was sensing CG eye candy ala \"Transformers II: Revenge of the Fallen\".With so many films being released on 3-D (which I have been told that \"Avatar\" must be seen in 3-D), in some ways, I just want to watch my movies straight. It's not the 3-D that makes me excited, it's the good ol' fashioned form of cinema. But with today's technology, for a sci-fi film, I'm expecting a beautiful scenery in this new world, unique characters, good acting, well-paced and a well-written storyline and most of all, because it's James Cameron who has raised the bar with \"Titanic\", I expect the best and not sci-fi kitsch.Of course, \"Avatar\" has gone on to breaking records and fan anticipation of the Blu-ray and DVD release are high (despite the first release being barebones) and upon receiving my review copy, I admit that I was curious about the film. What will James Cameron bring to the big screen in terms of character development, storyline and what message does he have for the viewer. Without it becoming an all eye candy film.Well, let's just say that after I watched \"Avatar\", I was blown away. Yes, \"Avatar\" is eye candy but it's pleasing eye candy that has a strong storyline behind it. Films such as the \"Star Wars\" or \"Lord of the Rings\" films have been able to take the viewer and let them believe they are away from reality and you know these worlds. That is why so many decades later, people still know the settings, the surroundings of these films and the same can be said about \"Avatar\".Like those films that will forever be etched in the minds of movie fans, \"Avatar\" will do the same as people will remember the lush world of Pandora, it's creatures but most of all the Na'vi. Technology is to the point where creatures or other life forms do not need to don a rubber suit or wear excessive make-up to make one think that being is from another planet. Somehow the wizards were able to take the likeness if Sam Worthington, Sigourney Weaver, Zoey Saldana and make the characters of Jake Sully and his avatar, Neytiri and Dr. Grace Augustine come alive.The detail of this film is amazing. On Blu-ray, it's fantastic! The detail and vibrant colors come alive in full effect. The characters on both the human and Na'vi side are believable and the acting is not forced. I admit that very early on the film, I thought about the character of Jake Sully (and no offense to Sam Worthington) but we were going to get something similar to Channing Tatum's Duke (\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\") and deal with a character that was concerned about his own virility and place as a soldier on Pandora but that is not the case. Worthington's Sully is a man is a disabled man who has found new life using his Avatar, the ability to take part in lifestyle of the Omaticaya, embrace it and find love with Neytiri, the planet and its inhabitants.The chemistry between the characters of Jake Sully and Neytiri is natural but works extremely well. And for fans of James Cameron films, to see Sigourney Weaver in \"Avatar\" is a nostalgic blessing. She may not be as forceful as her character of Ripley in the \"Alien\" films but her role as Dr. Grace Augustine was well-done.In fact, I felt the movie and it's pacing for a longer film was well-done, the viewer is immersed in the world but also gets to see political corruption and greed come to play and how Cameron is able to work this film and make it exciting and believable underneath all the CG is quite amazing. What the \"Star Wars\" films were to me back in the late '70s and early '80s, \"Avatar\" was a film that captivated my attention throughout its 162 minutes and made me appreciate what sci-fi films today can accomplish (granted, not many films will ever get the budget that Cameron was able to achieve with this film).But as this film has received mostly positive reviews, I was surprised to read \"Salon\" critic Stephanie Zacharek's opening paragraph of her review. Zacherek writes, \"The problem with taking 15 years to bring audiences the future of filmmaking is that someone else is bound to get to the future before you do. And while there are certain technical effects in James Cameron's \"Avatar\" that aren't quite like anything we've ever seen before, the movie is hardly a historical event, or even a grand achievement. It is a very expensive-looking, very flashy entertainment, albeit one that groans under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and features some of the most godawful dialogue this side of `Attack of the Clones'.\"I disagree with Zacharek's comment of the movie is a grand achievement. The film has broken box office records worldwide and now has its place in the record books as the #1 earning film in the world. Granted, for critics...many probably didn't think early on that James Cameron could repeat his box office success that he did with \"Titanic\", let alone beat that record with a sci-fi film. But he did and if that is not an grand achievement, I don't know what Zacharek was expecting. Even if you remove yourself from the earnings, the CG work is amazing. The cinematography is amazing and just the amount of detail on the characters at this time is phenomenal. And when you think about its competition during the Oscar year, \"Avatar\" was deserving in winning \"Best Achievement in Art Direction\", \"Best Achievement in Cinematography\" and \"Best Achievement in Visual Effects\".She goes on to say that the film was under the weight of clumsy storytelling in the second half and like many sci-fi films, there must be action. You know early on that there is a war coming between the humans and the Na'vi. It's expected, it's going to happen and yes, you are going to lose some of that emotional connect through those sequences. And the \"godawful dialogue\", I did mention this earlier on in my review that I felt that the character of Jake Skully was getting near Channing Tatum's Duke but for \"Avatar\", it works. Skully is introduced in the beginning as someone completely opposite of his intellectual brother and it shows.But similar to Zacharek, I was surprised that \"Village Voice\" critic J. Hoberman would feel the same about the second half as well. Hoberman writes, \"For the first 45 minutes, I'm thinking: Metropolis!--and wondering how to amend ballots already cast in polls of the year's best movies. Then the 3-D wears off, and the long second act kicks in.\"I found the comment to be quite interesting and for the most part, I can see where Hoberman is coming from in comparisons of both films. Where the Fritz Lang epic featured a man from the upper-level associating with and underground woman in which the underground has been subjective to corporate corruption to its highest level, I see the connection but at the same time, comparing \"Metropolis\" and \"Avatar\" is comparing apples to oranges. Where both films feature a revolt, \"Metropolis\" denizens have lived their monotonous life the same every day and are not warriors. In \"Avatar\", the Na'vi are losing their homeland, their planet is being destroyed and they have either the choice to give up and move to another area or fight. And what kind of film would \"Avatar\" be if we watched these warriors being displaced?The second half needed that battle and like \"Metropolis\", where Freder joins Maria in the grand fight, Sully joining the Na'vi was just right! That battle needed to be epic and for an audience who have sat that long at the theater for something grand to happen, this was their pay off. Yes, the film is pragmatic but for a sci-fi film, it works and definitely not kitsch.So, I came away enjoying \"Avatar\" much more than I expected. The Blu-ray delivered in picture and audio quality. Special features are none but similar to \"Sin City\" which came out with a near barebones DVD release was then given a magnificent Blu-ray release much later and it's expected the same will happen to \"Avatar\". I am sure like the video releases of \"Titanic\" and \"Terminator 2', Cameron has a lot of planned for the upcoming ultimate or special edition of \"Avatar\". This release was just to satisfy the masses who have enjoyed the film and definitely looks and sounds incredible in HD.I know many people may hold off until the better version of \"Avatar\" is released on Blu-ray but for now, if you want to enjoy \"Avatar\" now, you can. James Cameron's \"Avatar\" is the best looking film on Blu-ray since the release films on Blu-ray disc. Although, this is not the ultimate release of \"Avatar\" and does not include any special features, in terms of picture and audio quality alone, \"Avatar\" has not only broken box office records, it has raised the bar on what perfection looks and sounds like on Blu-ray.Highly recommended!", "domain": "movies", "id": "ea63a76fd4f3ad9a8acfc1d3e27bd12b", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "color", "nn_mod": "amazing", "q_reviews_id": "a6240d459341a7980a77208672ffd24c", "query_asp": "color", "query_mod": "vivid", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "What the quality of color?", "question_subj_level": 2, "review_id": "6345ec30e876b12dec3de7fd545e60c1", "title": "B002VPE1AW", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Without a doubt, the worst hotel (and I use the word hotel loosely) I hqave ever stayed in.

Remember the excitement that rushed through you, and how over the moon you were? Yeah that was me. In all my young adult glory, when I read the blurb of Divergent, reviews, the lot, and I finally found it in my local bookstore, I was the hyperactive child.We start off on the day of the aptitude test. Engaging already. The concept is what draws readers in first of all. Well that, and the interesting writing style, almost like Tris' literal stream of consciousness. Once you begin reading, your eyes eagerly absorbing all the wonderful descriptions of how houses in the Abnegation sector, are set up, what it's like living and schooling there, and the details of the aptitude test. Yes, the aptitude test was where I knew I'd get hooked on the book.Then came the Choosing Ceremony, and by this point we know enough about our protagonist, to sympathise with her when she chooses to transfer to Dauntless. Tris' character is so well fleshed out early in the novel that every decision she makes, every happening she experiences, every obstacle she encounters, it almost feels like the readers are there with her, by her side. I can't stress how important that is in a book, good characterisation that is. We readers have to actually care about the characters!The Dauntless initiation events were probably my favourite part of the book! I being a stereotypical boy, just loved any little bit of action I could get and Dauntless.. well being Dauntless, provided enough of that for me! I absolutely fell for the one on one fights, and the combination of my love for the action and sympathy for Tris when she was getting her ass kicked, made it very difficult for me to stop reading, even at two in the morning! The chapters were so riveting and chalk-full of events, that you just couldn't help but read on. It'd have been a crime to do such a thing! Though the pace of the story was slow in parts, it wasn't slow enough to give you a reason to get bored. Also vice-versa, it was fast enough that you were kept thoroughly entertained throughout the novel, but wasn't too fast that readers were easily lost either!I'm always in the mood for a good mushy romance, once it doesn't dominate the plot, so I was all for Fourtris! I love that both characters respected each other, and themselves, enough to control themselves and not get too carried away all the time.Towards the ending, things definitely got very exciting, and I had to read the last few chapter over and over to actually comprehend what had happened! Haha. Once again, we admire Tris' steely determination and rational mind when she realises that her fellow initiates are under the control of the serum, when she's separated from Four and when she finds her Dad and the other stiffs. Loss after loss, Tris keeps herself together and she manages to save not only herself from Four, and Four from the serum, but also all the other initiates too! Well done Tris!Anyway the ending was fantastic, leaving just enough covered to leave readers itching for more! The characterisation and writing styles were probably the strongest features, and I will say I was hoping to read a little bit on how their society became the society they know it to be, but I understand not everything can be given away in the one book!

We were lucky when trying to make a reso for 4 on a Friday at the last minute that they were able to fit us in for a set amount of time. Parking is a bit wonky here so I'd recommend you also hail a cab to get here as I'm not sure that taking the TTC to get here is possible later on in the evenings/weekends.We grabbed our table and hunkered down for what I anticipated would be an equally amazing meal to what I've come to expect. It's a small place, and when packed you'd be hard pressed to back your chair up without backing into someone so if you like your space then maybe pick a less busy night. That said, if you like a cozy lively dining experience then this is your jimmy-jam friendo!What I liked:- Three choices in guacamole (mild medium and hot), we ordered a hot for the fellas and a mild for our ladies who weren't as fond as the spice. I'm no master spice connoisseur but the hot was a 2 alarm at best (our of 5) so I think even someone with spice sensitivity can handle it. Came out quick with amazing tortilla chips as expected. Always a winner - Tacos, the short rib tacos are the house speciality and they certainly deliver in taste and in presentation. The meat was tender the fillings were excellent and the tortillas were a lovely cross between soft and crispy.- service, friendly, helpful and attentive. Despire beign slammed, we never waited too long for anything including re-ups on drinks and/or asking questionsWhat I didn't like:- Tacos, yes I know I said I liked them, and I definitely do, but unlike the Hacienda and Cantina locations, you're only allowed to order 3 of the same kind of tacos, where the other locations you can order singles. To get a fourth of the same kind will run you and extra $4. Just my preference but I like my choice when I'm splurging my calories on a taco night out- Space, As i mentioned, it's a tight fit, I like a little more room, not much but a little.Overall a good experience, but I'm definitely more partial to Cantina and I'm looking forward to trying Hacienda soon as well as their new Annex location which is a Korean fusion style joint!Eatcrest Out!PS - even saw titan of Canadian grocery business Gaelan Weston doing taco take-away while we were eating.

Skullcandy will replace them for any reason, whenever - just go to their website, register your product, and fill out the warranty form. You will receive CREDIT for their website that you can use on whatever you like, as well as free shipping. The amount of credit will depend upon the current price of your product on THEIR website - so for the standard INK'D buds, you will get a $20 credit. You do not need any proof of purchase, and it does not matter how much time has passed - just pop the broken buds into a small envelope and you're good.Firstly, I want to mention a few important tidbits that you should know.1. Pay attention to the L and R (engraved on the stem) on these earbuds, which can be hard to see. Do not reverse them, as doing so can affect fit and sound quality. I find putting a piece of colored tape on the right cord makes life easier.2. Don't assume you know which gel size will fit you best; make sure you try on all 3 gel sizes that come with these, as using the wrong size can dramatically decrease sound quality and comfort. If your earbuds are uncomfortable or the sound quality does not meet your expectations, then you likely have the wrong size gel installed. For myself, I automatically went with the smallest size because my ears are small, but those made the earbuds sound like cheap garbage. It wasn't until I tried the next size up did I get the full quality of sound that these are designed for. So pay attention to this, since it really matters.3. These have a straight plug, not an L-shaped plug. So you will need to be extra careful as a straight-plug design increases the amount of pressure both on the plug, and the headphone jack of your player. This leads to frayed wires or a loosening of the headphone jack, or both, which ultimately lead to the classic problem of only one side having sound.4. The cord is long - measures approximately 4 feet, 5 inches.5. Burn-in works with these. Slightly.Now, as for the build quality - I'm impressed. They are not cheaply made earbuds, despite their low price. The wires are nice and solid, and feel very well made - not flimsy or plastic-y. The silicone gels (tips that go in your ear) are very soft and pliable, and even have the Skullcandy logo engraved on them. Nice touch.They feel good, too. Really good. Both the material, and the way they fit my annoyingly small ears. And they don't fall out constantly, although I do sometimes get the sensation that it's getting sucked into my left ear.And yes, these come with 3 different size gels.Sound is great. These handle bass extremely well for mid-tier earbuds, and highs aren't so shrill and piercing as with other comparable brands. Some of this really depends on your player, too. Even between iPods, sound quality does differ.As far as functionality goes, I find I am able to run with these with no problem. The wires do not get tangled, and you can easily adjust the split in them with an attached slider (that has 'Skullcandy' written on it in the corresponding colour), which I find very convenient. I do not hear this thumping sound that others claim to hear from wire-movement, so I can't confirm that.The only things I dislike are the straight plug, and the lack of a case. Otherwise, I am thoroughly impressed with Skullcandy. The craftsmanship, the quality of sound, and all the little extras that Skullcandy does that really lets you know that they are paying attention, and that they care about their products and end-users.Worth every penny.UPDATE 12/31/2011 - My current pair has seen daily use for over a year now with no issues.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "2b19317d799bf636feec9bd370f21127", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "wire", "nn_mod": "nice", "q_reviews_id": "9d9304d16eab99a10db5825137902817", "query_asp": "cord", "query_mod": "good", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the cord?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "85471013a2972fa1253c3cac6974d463", "title": "B003GIJTR8", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [544], "text": ["The bathroom was small"]}, "context": "After a lovely stay in 2003 we said we'd love to come back and we did in April 2005 for 14 days.We had a two queen bedroom, corner suite on the 15th floor with stunning views which provided a great backdrop for breakfast.

The Coen Brothers have always been a favorite of my family and The Dude looks, acts, and talks exactly like my dead father.That said, my high score for this film is not just because I like it, but because it's excellent. I'm going to save the usual great directing, acting, cinematography, editing, and humor (all of which it has) and move into a few unique traits of this film that never cease to fascinate me no matter how many times I watch it.First of all, the dialog specifically. Move over, Tarantino and Kevin Smith, you have been owned. This dialog is faster, wittier, more real, and creates better characters through tangents than you could hope possible. Was the dialog even written down? Most of the time it seems the actors are just playing off each other's direction and they are talking about whatever they want to, and yet previous conversations and conceits and the like keep re-emerging later, characters go off on regular tangents (and I'm not just talking about the Vietnam War, either), and the actors never, ever fall out of character. It's amazing to behold.Secondly, the storyline's general arch. Many conversations I've had with people end up going into a lot of discussion over the fact that he never gets his rug back. In fact, the whole movie is kind of tragic in the way The Dude ends up worse off than he was before, but then again he's happier and the status quo has returned, so it's still contained brilliantly. The thing is that the Coen brothers tend to write very character-driven plots, where the character's personalities do so much more than the events they create to propel them into more and more absurd situations. Furthermore, it's not like the characters just move on to the next scene and the last scene is almost irregardless, like a lot of lesser character-driven plots: it all ties together and is contained beautifully. This movie could not have ended any other way.Finally, I won't bore you with the regular talk about how great a character The Dude is (even though he is), I want to talk about Walter Sobchack. Honestly, this the role John Goodman was born to do, and of course he did it brilliantly. Not only can I not imagine anyone else doing it, I can't imagine anybody else perfectly complimenting Dude. Together with Donnie, the three make a relationship so much more real than almost ever shown on screen.And now we FINALLY, FINALLY have a three-disc special edition of the brilliance. This was long overdue. I loved my other copy because I love movies more than extras, but man is it good to know that this has been given some more treatment.

She's not too happy about the move but she loves and supports her mom's decision. Katy is also a book blogger. I must admit I was a little nervous when I read about that. However Jennifer L Armentrout pretty much nailed the blogger aspect of it. To satisfy her mom's request of not becoming antisocial, she goes next door to meet the neighbors. What she doesn't expect is that the events that unfold after she knocks on their door will change her life forever.The characters in the book are great. I loved each and everyone of them. Katy is the main character. She's feisty, inquisitive and stands up for herself. Dee, Daemon's sister is delightful. She's the perfect best friend. Daemon is a jerk in the beginning. He's arrogant, overprotective, and drop dead gorgeous. Katy and Daemon have chemistry. White hot chemistry.The story line in this book is very fast paced. It's full of action, adventure and a little romance. There are secrets to uncover, enemies to out run and if all that's not bad enough they have to go tackle senior year.

Young offers up complex characters, a fantastic setting and weaves it all together to create a romance that swept me away.The tale takes place primarily in Scotland after a brief prologue that gives us a strong sense of Jocelyn Butler's background. Jocelyn is in search of a new flat and roommate after graduation and is on her way to visit a place on Dublin Street when she hails a cab and ends up sharing it with Braden Carmichael. Their conversation was funny and right away we get a sense of who they are. She ends up falling in love with the flat and takes an immediately liking to Elle her new roommate. As fate would have it, it turns out that Elle is the little sister of Braden who is now Jocelyn's landlord. The tale that unfolds held me captive as Jocelyn struggles with her past, her feelings for Elle and Braden, and a fear of losing herself.Young created fleshed out characters with flaws you can identify with. Jocelyn from the outside appears confident, calculated and snarky. She keeps people at a distance, tucking them into neat little boxes with labels. I instantly connected with her, and despite wanting to shake her a few times, I felt her emotions and struggles were genuine. Elle is in a word, \"adorable\" Ever optimistic, a totally romantic and someone you enjoy spending time with. She is a listener, and very good at picking up on subtle body language. While she is curious about Jocelyn she doesn't push her. Braden is older than Jocelyn and has been previously hurt in a failed marriage. He is successful, and goes from one relationship to the next. He is charming, smexy and despite all the dating, he is faithful when in a relationship. There is an immediate physical attraction between them but Jocelyn tries very hard to deny it. Braden really gets her, and cleverly worms his way into her life and bed. It was fun to watch it all unfold. Their relationship is hot, sweet, turbulent, intense and beautiful. I found myself wrapped up emotionally in the outcome. The secondary characters all had their own voice, and personalities making the setting intimate.There were many threads in the story, quickly making me invested in the characters and while it focused on Jocelyn I found myself caught up in the other characters lives as well. Jocelyn has secrets and carries a lot of grief but we see growth throughout the novel. Young has her seeing a therapist and I loved that she made Jocelyn strong enough to realize she needed to talk to someone. I consumed this in a single evening and enjoyed the author's writing style and plot pacing. There are some hot, steamy scenes, that are detailed enough to let your imagination soar. I quickly slipped away from reality as the world and characters she created took me on an emotional journey I did not want to end.

There is also a decent amount of protein (6 grams, slightly less than the Cherry Cashew bar), and although the amount of sugar is higher than I would've liked (19 grams, or almost 4 teaspoons), the bar is naturally sweetened using agave nectar only, with no other added sugars added.The bar was thick and dense in appearance, with an almost slightly sticky feel. The taste definitely tastes fruity, but I could not detect a blueberry flavor at all. Rather, as other reviewers have suggested, the taste is more reminiscent of Fig Newtons, most likely because the first ingredient is actually dates (blueberries were significantly further down the list). The bar also did have a nutty flavor, and in fact it contains cashews, walnuts, and almonds. Overall, I liked the taste (I like dates!), but I thought the \"Wild Blueberry\" label was deceiving, and I definitely have had other bars that I prefer.In the end, I liked the Cherry Cashew Pure Bar a bit more than this one, and I would rate the nutritional profile of that flavor as slightly better as well.

In one very crucial way, it breaks tradition with the average domestic thriller: There's no infidelity. There's an awful lot of flirtation, no question, but when it comes to faithfulness, the married man gets high marks. I'm referring to Derek Charles (Idris Elba), a Los Angeles asset manager. He becomes the object of a new office temp's desire, and as we see over the film's 105 minutes, she'll go to just about any lengths to get what she's after. I agree that this is hardly an original premise, and at times, the film seems more interested in being formulaic than in being compelling. But at the very least, it makes due with what little it has, which is to say that it's perfectly acceptable.It's a classic scenario: Not only has Derek just been promoted to the rank of Executive Vice President, he also has a beautiful family and a luxurious new house. He's respected by his colleagues, his superiors trust him deeply, and he has great friends. Things are going really well.Then comes the day he enters an elevator and meets Lisa (Ari Larter), a sultry beauty with long blonde hair and a killer figure. She's carrying a large amount of paperwork, so much so that she inevitably drops them in a moment of clumsiness. Derek, trying to be nice, offers to help her out, and that leads to the next inevitable moment--they reach for the same piece of paper at the same time, resulting in their hands touching. There's nothing subtle about this. For that matter, there's nothing subtle about the entire film, which has no qualms about going for the obvious.Take, for example, a scene that takes place some weeks after Derek and Lisa first meet: Derek walks into the lounge area and sees Lisa on the verge of tears. He assumes she's having boyfriend trouble, and encourages her by saying how pretty she is and how any man would be lucky to know her. In fact, if he was single ... ah, but he doesn't finish his sentence. There are two specific reasons why people do this: (1) some people don't actually mean it when they say it, so there's no point in completing the thought; (2) some people are afraid that they do mean what they're saying, and therefore don't want to incriminate themselves any further. What reasoning do you think Derek followed? Choose whichever one you think applies. I have a feeling the filmmakers wanted it to be ambiguous.It isn't long before Derek regrets ever having met Lisa. In spite of the fact that she's incredibly efficient (at times frighteningly so), she rapidly becomes overly friendly, pretty much to the point of intrusiveness. It isn't until the annual office Christmas party that things begin taking a darker turn; Lisa takes advantage of the fact that Derek has had one too many and tries to have sex with him in a bathroom stall. He wards her off, but that doesn't stop her from trying again the next day, when she insistently gets into his car as he's leaving work.Before I go any further, let me backtrack a bit and talk about Derek's wife, Sharon (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles), who looks bootylicious but acts, for the most part, like a typical wife and mother. When she first learns that a new female temp is working for Derek, she jokingly chides him for allowing such a thing to happen. Then the two actually meet, and while it's too early for Sharon to be suspicious, she definitely shows concern. Let's face it--Lisa's a beautiful woman and Derek is a handsome man. It doesn't take a genius to see what could potentially happen.As Lisa's attempts at seduction grow more and more brazen, Derek finds himself in a very awkward position, desperate to maintain his reputation but even more desperate to distance himself from Lisa. There inevitably comes a point at which Sharon finds out that something isn't quite right, that Lisa labors under the delusion that Derek is in love with her. This paves the way for the final confrontation, which, for me at least, was the weakest section of the film, designed less like a plausible plot point and more like an excuse to have two women fighting. I have no doubt many will see this movie specifically for this scene.There are other aspects that don't work too well, including a strange camaraderie between Lisa and a gay office assistant named Patrick (Matthew Humphreys). Within the context of this story, I failed to see how this character was necessary--other than a few stereotypical one-liners and some witty banter, he contributes nothing to the story. There's also Derek's office buddy, Ben (Jerry O'Connell), a sex-hungry party animal who seems to lack the conviction of his personality. He too contributes nothing to the story. Fortunately, these are side characters that have little bearing on either the central story or the three main characters, all of which are the most developed components of \"Obsessed.\" While hardly a masterpiece, it's an entertaining thriller that achieved exactly what it wanted to achieve. And even if Beyonc&eacute; Knowles is better suited for more meaningful characters like Etta James, she has once again proven herself as a competent actress.", "domain": "movies", "id": "26a50807a2159e429ae66277e3b0484d", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "people", "nn_mod": "afraid", "q_reviews_id": "507ade90556d43758159147a339c6290", "query_asp": "performance", "query_mod": "convince", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is roberts performance?", "question_subj_level": 2, "review_id": "cfa83ef4758c81f1f2284fa7f6dce7e4", "title": "B002CAWNDS", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "I've mixed feelings about this novel.

The infamous score by Harry Manfredini is excellent and scary and carries the film very well. The cast of basic unknowns adds to the sense of isolation that the makers of this film knew was a key element to making it as frightening as it is.Critics love to trash this movie but it must have done something right to spawn more sequels than any other.The plot probably needs no explanation but goes simply like this: Counselors setting up a camp in the middle of the woods are killed one by one in, each in a different grisly manner, but who is doing the killing?Many people take so many aspects of this film for granted because it has been ripped-off so many times (although, to be fair, it is somewhat a rip-off in itself of Halloween - using a holiday and a slasher killing teens). But this film introduced many elements into a genre it would actually almost invent by itself - the slasher film.First off all, we have the wooded setting, next we have a series of gruesome and creative killings (tamed by today's standards), using the camera to make you, the viewer, see the slaying of the victims through the eyes of the killer.The shock-ending of this film was probably the most effective of its kind in movie history and during its run at the theaters, you would inevitably hear a tremendous letout of screams right before the movie ended (I won't mention what this is just on the slight notion that someone doesn't know what I'm talking about). But the reason this scene succeeded so well was simple...because the film effectively created a genuiune feeling of terror and suspense for the first 85 minutes and took viewers by surprise.FRIDAY THE 13TH looks great in this digitally remastered widescreen DVD and helps to eliminate the dated look it was taking on due to increasingly poorer VHS releases. The only special features that this film does have are the trailer (which is not remastered but shows the great contrast between the remastered and unremastered prints) and chapter selection. Unfortunately this is not the un-cut version but for some reason does contain a few extra seconds of blood in one scene (the third killing in the film of Annie) and a few deleted scenes in another (the decapitation near the end of the movie) and also contains a few extra seconds of the sex scene. An uncut version or collector's edition has been cried out for amongst the many fans of FRIDAY THE 13TH but has been inexplicably ignored by its distributor, Paramount Pictures, who basically view this cash cow as a blemish on the face of their film catalog.", "domain": "movies", "id": "7b01457cc289f974fbf7304594b38cb3", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "reason", "nn_mod": "simple", "q_reviews_id": "4bf222329095def00f49a5f4b169c929", "query_asp": "credit", "query_mod": "due", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "Do you have any credit?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "cc88f07befcbe1efc13f997f5043410a", "title": "6300214087", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "This book was just OK for me.

To my mind, the pasta is usually just a vehicle for whatever topping we're going to put on it! That said, however, Barilla has become our most common choice over the last few years. Why? A couple of reasons, really. Price-wise, this is usually one of the more economical choices. The pasta is reliable and tasty, the variety is impressive, there is a whole grain option, and there is even a new PLUS line for those looking to increase their protein intake.Recently, I received a whole slew of Barilla to try out. Some of these are regulars on my table (like the Whole Grain) and some were first time uses. Again, though, Barilla is a brand I swear by and use almost every week. I just find it hard to gush about food products.Whole Grain Spaghetti (4 1/2 stars): We frequently opt for the whole grain option, I suppose it seems like the healthier alternative. As we've gotten older, we've consciously tried to up our fiber intake and this does so in a pleasant way. Made with 51% whole wheat, we also think these are tastier than traditional pasta. Typical spaghetti preparation.Whole Grain Thin Spaghetti (5 stars): A thinner choice, this gives you the benefits of the whole grains and fiber but mixes better with sauces.Whole Grain Linguine: (5 Stars): One of out preferred choices. Obviously, we are crazy for the Whole grain option, but like the flat linguine as the option that works best for think and rich sauces.Mezze Penne (4 stars): We eat a surprising amount of Penne and this Mezze is slightly thinner in cylindrical format. Cooks up and maintains its shape well. We often do baked dishes where we cook the pasta first, then bake it. Even double prepared, they hold their shape well and taste good. Better integrity under these circumstances than the wider penne.Linguine Fini (4 1/2 stars): These delineations amuse me. It had never occurred to me that I needed an even thinner Linguine, so (of all of these choices) this was probably the one I wouldn't have tried on my own. But we tend to like this (angel hair is one of our top choices), so this was tasty enough.Oven Ready Lasagna (4 stars): I don't do lasagna very often and never from scratch! If you are a short-cut cook like me, you want things to make your life easier. These noodles don't require any pre-boiling and cook while the dish is baking. It's a brilliant idea that works well for the most part. Due to inconsistencies in layering, you might have sections that crisp up more than others. But a little unevenness is a willing trade for the pain of making traditional lasagna.Ditalini Soup Cuts (4 stars): This is one of the products that I probably wouldn't have picked up of my own accord. I'm simply not a soup maker. But these little pasta cylinders were actually very nice, and super easy to use. We added them to a crock pot preparation. I was afraid they might dissolve completely, but they held up well and added a nice dimesion.Penne Plus (4 stars): This is like the premium choice in Barilla, and so it is more expensive. It's not my first choice. But it would appeal to those that are looking to add protein to their diet, like vegetarians. It has protein and Omega 3's, and is made with healthy ingredients like flax seed and legumes. It takes a little longer to cook, but still tastes fine.

The characters are nowhere near as interesting or ambivalent as lets say in Game of Thrones, nor do the plot or the characters take any surprising twists or turns.I'd say it's popcorn fiction. The book does by no means come anywhere near R.R.Martin's books (Game of Thrones) or books written by William Gibson ... neither in complexity/atmosphere nor in their tendency to surprise.

In general, the acting was excellent, the photography was good, and the script was mediocre.This is a story about two dissatisfied people who meet and can relate to one another. It's a story that's been told a million times before, most famously in its incarnation as the British classic &quot;A Brief Encounter&quot;. &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; sports far better performances by its leads and will of course be more accessible to a contemporary audience, but suffers from a weaker script.Living in (and loving) Japan myself, I found many of the stereotypes to be untrue and, occassionally, objectionable. However, &quot;Japan&quot; was not the theme of this movie. The characters could have been anywhere, so long as it was someplace that made them feel like &quot;outsiders&quot;, and Tokyo, as it is presented in the West, is a modern location which most Westerners think of as distant in every sense of the word. Of course, the Tokyo presented in this film is the image we get in the States (via Hollywood, television, and any number of fringe news articles about social trends and electronic gadgets), as opposed to the real place. As an example, for those of you who have been to New York City, compare the real thing with the city presented to you in the movie &quot;Seven&quot;, which plays to every stereotype purveyed by those who have never visited of crime, perversity and destitution.The slow speed of the film did not bother me in the least. It's a film about the characters, not their environment, past, or future. It's a study of loneliness and anger. Charlotte, an otherwise educated woman, bad-mouths everything she sees or tries, from the lunch she eats with Bob (&quot;shabu-shabu&quot;, which is delicious, by the way), to the pronunciation of the locals' English. This shouldn't be confused with an endorsement of those sentiments on the part of the director. Rather, it is a window into the character's own youth (read: childishness) and inexperience, coupled with her deep unhappiness with her own life.I do not agree that most people who have visited a foreign environment should relate to this. I fully endorse a number of other reviewers who have mentioned that a normal person would be interested in the adventure of Japan, of seeing new things, and of interacting with new people. But Bob and Charlotte are not normal people. If they were, there would be no movie. What makes a movie worth watching (any movie) is that it is about something out of the ordinary, whether that something occurs outside of the characters or inside.That said, I often found Bob's jokes at the expense of the people around him to be in bad taste. Almost every Japanese person he met in this movie was going out of their way to be kind and make him feel at home, but he often made fun of them. This is the kind of behavior that is often considered &quot;cool&quot; in the West, but you won't find much of it in Japan, thank goodness.I've mentioned above, you don't need to agree with everything these characters do- they're not heroes- but his actions damaged my ability to sympathize with him.As for the dialogue itself, this is a film with less dialogue than average, so it was a pity to see so many throw-away lines. I realize that most of the acting and character-development was silent, but that's no reason not to have quality dialogue also. A small example of this is the scene in the strip-club. Nothing here is said of any imporance. In fact, the entire scene could have been lifted right out of the movie without effect.Finally, to review the DVD itself. Please note that my rating of four stars is for the film, not the DVD, which would get two at best. This is the one and only DVD I have ever owned or rented which actually requires you to watch all of the previews. To me, this is unforgiveable, and it is enough to ensure that I will never purchase another title from Focus Features. The only option you have is to fast-forward, old-fashioned VCR-style. This is bad enough, but my own player has only 2x fast forwarding available, making the process annoying, to put it extremely mildly and expletive-free.In short, this film is worth watching at least once, but (DVD aside) I doubt it will stand up to repeat viewings for most people.", "domain": "movies", "id": "8a33de11a968d218b1fb010a7aa4cac2", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "film", "nn_mod": "worth to watch", "q_reviews_id": "ee9ea250289b918b0f59928449815269", "query_asp": "cinematography", "query_mod": "perfect", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is cinematography?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "538f9ee6b35190c6874f4359f9a0e067", "title": "B00005JMJ4", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "We stayed at the Tuscan for the last two nights of our holiday following our return from Las Vegas.

No? Then this is the book for you cause this is how I just felt after finishing &#8220;Raw&#8221; by Belle Aurora. With this book it took all my willpower not to lock myself in the bathroom while the family was celebrating New Year&#8217;s Eve just so I could finish it &#8211; needing to find out what happens next. This book destroyed me, it broke me. I felt as if Belle Aurora stuck my heart, my mind and my soul in a blender and set it on high and then just walked away. For the last quarter of the book and still about three hours later I was a sobbing and blubbering mess. It was so much more than I expected and I already had high expectations. This book evoked so many emotions in me &#8211; pain, despair, disbelief, contentment, happiness, hate, disgust, fear and a broken heart. The story gave me whiplash as I was basically torn between emotions on a minutely basis. One moment I was full of hate, the next moment that was replaced by sympathy. Then swooning like a love-sick lunatic, right before feeling appalled and out of my comfort zone. And I loved every bit of it.When Belle Aurora said that this is a story about a love gone wrong, she wasn&#8217;t kidding. I really should have believed it. This story is different and original. Not something I have read before. It is dark and twisted and transformed my brain to mush. Well, my heart too. And my ovaries suffered a little as well.It is the story of Twitch and Lexi. Each of them having lived through a difficult and tormented past and still managed to succeed &#8211; each in their own way. Their meeting and relationship is, well, let&#8217;s say unusual and twisted as hell. But that is to be expected if you develop feelings for your stalker. And that is exactly what Lexi does. Little does she know there is more to him than just some guy that likes to follow women around. And little does he know that she is the only one that can save him from himself. Their relationship made me cringe at times. I found myself shaking my head in disbelief, wanting to shake the characters to make them wake-up and see what was going on. This couple and their relationship is unique. I&#8217;ve never read about a relationship like theirs. And yes, at times it took me out of my comfort zone. But that means the book is good. It makes me feel and think new things, it makes me reconsider my point of view. Amazing, when a story can do this.I can&#8217;t tell you much more about the story without giving too much away. And that is not something I want to do. The story is too good for you not to experience it yourself.What I can tell you is a bit about the characters.There is Lexi. She is a woman to look up to. Having overcome pain and sorrow that her childhood and youth have been filled with, she is now someone who helps others &#8211; giving all her heart and soul. She believes in the good of people and doesn&#8217;t judge. I liked her character a lot. Despite what she went through she wasn&#8217;t broken. She was happy and loving, stable and caring. Her friendship with Dave and Nikki was absolutely adorable. But when it came to Twitch, that girl left her brain on the bedside table. Sometimes I wanted to grab her by the shoulders and give her a decent shake in the hopes of maybe bringing her brain cells back to life. But then I suppose the heart will win over the brain any time and there was not much she could do about it.Twitch on the other hand is one complex and twisted man. Most of the time I was torn between wanting to punch him in the throat or rip his clothes off. He was all domineering, controlling alpha-male with a big dose of bad-to-the-bone added to the mix. And yet, despite his often brutal, demeaning and heartless behaviour, I just couldn&#8217;t help but like him a bit. There was more to him than this sick-in-the-head man. And finding out what it was &#8211; that was excruciating as hell. I love that up until the end of the book, I could not make up my mind if I hate him or love him. But yet I couldn&#8217;t help wishing for him to be happy, not able to just think in black and white. Not able to just judge him. To make me feel like this about a character like Twitch, that was a job well done by Belle Aurora.The story will shock and rock you and trust me, you will love every second of it. For me, this is the best start possible to a new book year.

When we made our reservation we were torn between booking two separate non-suite rooms or the adjoining two bedroom suite. We ended up going with the two separate rooms because of the giant cost difference. When we arrived at Hotel Drisco to check in, we were told that my parent's room had been upgraded to a suite, however both rooms were located in the basement, down the hall from the service entrance, across from an ice machine and the breakfast room. Our windows overlooked the kitchen of the hotel and the rooms were very dark. Needless to say we were disappointed and considered switching hotels, however the desk staff was able to move us both into an adjoining two bedroom suite on the corner of the top floor. The new rooms had beautiful light, gorgeous views of the Bay and Alcatraz and it was like we were staying in a completely different hotel. We loved, loved loved our new rooms.The adjoined two bedroom suites are great if you're traveling as a group, however one of the bedrooms in these two bedroom suites has no bathroom attached. You have to cross the private hall (to which both bedrooms in the suite have access) to get to the bathroom. If the person staying in the other bedroom is not traveling with you, you could conceivably be walking out of your shower into your room and pass a stranger in the hall. It was a bit bizarre. I would recommend this hotel ONLY if you are given a room on the top two floors. It would be quite loud otherwise, and much less private. The only problem is, you are given no guarantees as to where your room is until you check in. It's a bit of a gamble. Also, beware. The prices of rooms fluctuate. When we were moved to the double room suite, the price we were quoted at the desk was nearly $100 less per night than what we were quoted when we originally made the decision to stick with the smaller, single rooms. That said, bathrooms in both suites and non-suites were beautiful and large, the breakfast were very nice, and Thanh (sp?) the bellhop/doorman was so kind and friendly. We loved the private, neighborhood feel of Pacific Heights. There are some great nearby restaurants (try Sociale) and the buses run frequently if you're wanting to go further afield.

So when I was looking for another lens I checked this lens out and read many reviews and decided to go ahead and purchase this one \"last\"(LOL)lens. I got it before we went to visit family at Christmas and couldn't be more pleased. The shots were clear and sharp and if I had had time to practice more I am sure the shots would have been even better. I am a novice and do not ever plan to be a professional but just want to do some really nice shots for me. I use point and shoots just for fun but my iphone does just about as good and use my canon for those nice set up shots or nature shots.I read many reviews and agreed with most of them. The lens is light but not cheap feeling to me and is my most used lens. I use my big telephoto zoom lens for nature shots as we live in Colorado and the shots are amazing if you wait for them.

The pace throughout was steady and relaxed. While I always wanted to know what happened next, I never felt a sense of urgency, which was kind of refreshing. It&#8217;s like the book keep assuring me that things would happen, and I&#8217;d be there for them, but I didn&#8217;t need to rush. The best thing, though? Many times while reading, I&#8217;d come across a sentence with words so perfectly placed that I just about squealed right out of my seat! Each time was like finding a treasure and it made me appreciate the writing so much.I have to to tell you that my favorite parts of the book were the scenes that involved Blue and her psychic family. Learning about each psychic and her abilities, quirks, and personality was so much fun. When the scenes began to shift toward the raven boys, I wasn&#8217;t as interested. Why read about normal characters when I can read about mystical characters? Although, I must say, that once the story picked up with Gansey&#8217;s quest for leylines, I was much more interested in the scenes involving the boys.One of the coolest things about this book, in my opinion, is that its magic seemed so much closer to home than most other YA novels containing a supernatural element. Perhaps because it&#8217;s tied to things like tarot cards and legendary leylines. Things that already exist (more or less) in our world. Stiefvater did a great job of taking these concepts and building on them, bringing them to life in such unexpected and interesting ways.Something I really appreciated was the way that all of the characters were tied to one another. I loved getting to see the various facets of each character when they were interacting with one another, and when they were alone with themselves. Though I have to admit that I preferred the female characters, each of the raven boys grew on me as the story progressed.Honestly, I think one of the weakest parts of the story was the raven boys themselves. Gansey is the main male character, and while I enjoyed following him on his quest, at the end I still didn&#8217;t really feel like I knew him at all. Each raven boy had his own story weaved in throughout the book, but my favorite was Ronan. Yes, the troublemaker and jerkiest punk of them all. Maybe his story was told best? Or maybe, like Blue, I felt drawn to him because he seems so difficult to impress.Perhaps the bottom line is that I got to know each character a little, but right now we&#8217;re still acquaintances. Maybe we can&#8217;t be friends until the next book?Overall, I really enjoyed the story, and the roller coaster ride that Blue and her boys went through. I&#8217;m looking forward to book two, and hope that it has just as much of the magic as did book one. Most likely I&#8217;m going to re-read The Raven Boys before book two comes out, just so I can go on the adventure all over again.[NOTE: I originally read this book as an ARC, borrowed from my sister, who gets many, many amazing things in her mailbox.]", "domain": "books", "id": "667ad0fb1fef418de159ed66b640aeac", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "pace", "nn_mod": "steady", "q_reviews_id": "25c02362d1c4345ee33581109d0349d1", "query_asp": "story", "query_mod": "confuse", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How would you describe the story?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "4a31ed518b8bef278ec163dd26dc9715", "title": "0545424925", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [188, 188], "text": ["The bathroom was very nice", "The bathroom was very nice"]}, "context": "Spent a Saturday night in one of the imperial club rooms, which are on the 22nd and 23rd floors.

It is probably one of the better Korean restaurants that I have tried! It seems like all the best food joints are in the hood. Located in the Scarborough-Wexford area in a random plaza beside a Korean grocery store and of course under the Kim's Convenience billboard sign, this is a small restaurant with about 10-15 small tables. The first time we tried to come here there was a lineup and this time it was the same but throughout the night. We knew that this place must be good if people don't mind waiting minimum 15-20 mins. So after we sat down we also waited another 30 mins for our food but it was super busy and clearly the 3 servers wasn't enough to handle the volume of customers. It's okay though it was well worth the wait because the servers apologized for the wait and were even friendly.We decided to order the lettuce wrap combo with two meats and the pork bone soup that everyone was was raving about in the reviews. And ...wow must I say that despite the level of spiciness of the soup, it was delicious. The portion was massive, they definitely didn't cheap out on the meat and not to mention so much flavour and literally fell off the bone as you were eating it. The wrap combo we got to choose two meats: chicken teriyaki and bulgogi...both came on a sizzling plate bursting with so much flavour as you eat it wrapped up with lettuce and sauce. The combo also came 2 bowls of purple authentic Korean rice and tofu soup. The entire combo was only $30 enough to feed two people. And last but not least the appetizers were so good!!! There was a variety with kimchi, rice cakes, sweetened potato, bean sprouts, and eggplant! You can ask for unlimited appetizers if you'd like. If you are looking for a place to satisfy your pork bone soup craving, come here, you won't be disappointed.

I would find myself forgetting who was narrating in the middle of a chapter sometimes but I did appreciate getting to hear things from Tobias's point of view.

I was wrong. To start off, the special effects were one of the best I have ever seen in my entire life. Every scene was portrayed with color and vibrancy. It even made the Hallelujah Mountains (floating mountains) seem legitimate. Although the actors may not be exactly who you would have expected, they did a phenomenal job. When you are watching the movie you truly believe that the actors are the character they play. Each line was spoken with true feeling and emphasis. One of the most remarkable things about the movie was the language. The fact that the movie producers can create an entirely made up language and then have each actor memorize it is beyond me.On the surface it may seem that the storyline is pretty fantasized and has nothing to do with your life, but if you dig a little deeper you will realize that it is very relevant. The movie brings up the idea of corporate greed. The government wants to go to Pandora and harvest its riches. When they get there they realize that an entire population is settled on the land, but they do not care. All they want is the riches and therefore are willing to do anything to get it. I think that, along with some fighting scenes, is the reason it is truthfully rated pg13. Despite the great aspects, the fact that they name the ore that they cannot obtain \"unobtainium\" is pretty cheesy. If you are going to create an entire dialogue for the Navi you can at least come up with a clever name for some ore.My favorite scene was towards the end when Neytiri fought Colonel Miles Quaritch. This scene was very dramatic because Jake Sully was trapped unconscious and Neytiri had to get to him first otherwise he would die. The blows went back and forth, Neytiri riding a vicious beast, and Colonel Miles Quaritch fighting inside a robot. When Neytiri knocked Colonel Miles Quaritch's gun out of his hands he pulled out his knife and killed the beast. It landed on top of Neytiri trapping her under his corpse. This scene supports the theme of the movie which is trust. Neytiri had to decide whether or not to accept Jake as one of the Navi and had to trust him. The same went for Jake. He needed to decide whether or not he should trust the marines or the Navi.

MINE had us PMing at midnight the other night in excitement. We frantically discussed the moments where we sighed, screamed, along with the ones that caused our mouths to fall open. We'll admit now to wanting to smack a few people and shake sense into others.Remy, hands down, earned five HUGE RIPTIDE STARS from both of us!!\"It doesn't hurt. You. Crying in my f****** arms. Because I f****** hurt you. That hurts. You...not touching me. Not looking at me like you do, with those sweet little happy eyes. Hurts. I'm hurting like a motherf***** and not one piece of me hurts on the outside like it does where you make it hurt.\"I know for myself I was hooked from the opening page, and around the 10-15% mark, I started to curse Katy. I just knew she was going to wreck me. And damn, she seriously didn't waste any time. My heart sat heavy in my stomach. Between Remy's oppressive issues of mental illness and Brooke's bad decisions from REAL, we pick up right where they left off dealing with the impact and toll it has taken on one of our favorite couples, along with the rest of the crew. All I could think, was oh no, Katy, please don't go there. Well, Katy went there. She had my pulse pumping, my breath catching, and tears starting to form behind the eyes. My heart was breaking for both Brooke and Remy, especially for Rem. Then again around the 80-85% point, Katy managed to not just wreck me, she freaking shattered me. Big fat baby tears kind of shattered. I HAD to vent and share my feelings with someone. I told Kim to move it up her reading list now! I needed to discuss all that was going on and my girl started it and finished it by midnight.Oh, Remy, sigh, you seriously rocked our worlds once again. This time around there was so much more crippled darkness exuding from our hero, so much so, we were left in complete tatters on a quite a few occasions. Prepare yourselves people, Remy is without a doubt a hell of a lot more raw, and totally laid bare for the world to see. Katy hung all of Remy's demons out there, she poured her heart and soul into this character and never once pulled back. In MINE you'll find he is even more driven and determined, if that is possible, only this time around his focus is set on Brooke along with winning the underground championship. Remington will rip at your heart; your emotions will feel as though they are being pulled by strings. He is hotter than ever, a hell of a lot more possessive, and if you thought he was sexy in REAL then you haven't seen anything yet; he is OFF THE CHARTS DELICIOUS AND UNDENIABLY HOT in MINE. Holy freaking hell, this man will set your body and mind on fire.\"We're the object of each other's hurt and each other's solace.\"Brooke has made a commitment to follow Remy and be with him, but we'll soon find out she has some MAJOR issues with insecurity and jealousy. Nevertheless, Brooke is one of the few people that truly \"gets\" Remy and accepts all that he is. Brooke said it best when she said, \"loving him is the most exhilarating roller coaster I've ever ridden in my life.\" Although, she is dealing with her own irrational issues and doing her best to hold everything together, Brooke is his staunch advocate. Whether Remy is \"blue\" or \"black,\" she pulls her crap together to stand tall and strong along side him (well most times, anyways). This is the point where we stop and tell you it wasn't all sunshine and roses, there were times that she got on our nerves a bit, but overall we both agree that she's the perfect compliment to Remy.MINE is told from Brooke's point of view and in this case, she's probably the most reliable narrator. Remy's not always a good historian, especially when he's in the \"Black.\" And although, we would have liked to get inside his head in this one, we felt that he was vocal enough through his actions, words, and reactions. His emotions, even when he isn't actually saying anything are primal, gritty, and present loud and clear. Remy's character screams dominating yet vulnerable alpha male who would move heaven and earth for his soul mate. And in our opinion, some of the tension and mystery came from not knowing exactly what was going on in his mind.\"You, are going to love me until I die. I'm going to make you love me even if it hurts, and when it hurts, I'm going to make it better, Brooke. You're going to f***** love me if it kills us.\"Remy and Brooke's absolute need for each other is all consuming and insanely intense. They're all about saving one another. Each of them has their own demons to fight and the other holds the key to redemption. The chemistry between them is the epitome of penetrating and extreme, they literally can barely breathe without the other(hell their love and need left both of us breathless). Both hero and heroine are possessive and have marked the other on a deep level, a level most never have the chance of actually experiencing. This level of dependency rocks their foundation, combine this with negative outside influences and you have a recipe for complications. This in turn tests everything that defines them. Remy and Brooke are faced with layer upon layer of obstacles to overcome. Together can they find the inner strength to master these tests and grow as a couple?\"You're blinded because you're mine.\" \"No, I see you because I'm yours.\"Remy is one of our favorite book boyfriends for many reason, but mainly because of his intensity, his fierce protectiveness and need, and his loving spirit. He is strong yet vulnerable at the same time. Remy struggles every day with his brokenness, however with every word across the page, his character shows progression to becoming whole. The change within him just sucks you right in and holds you captivated until the very last page.This book has it all. It is raw, real, powerful, suspenseful, passionate, and literally gut punching. There were action-packed fight scenes, steamy sex scenes, tension, and strong emotions. It showed how two broken people could form a tight bond that could withstand almost anything.Katy's writing once again is phenomenal as well as powerful, it's written from deep within, and she manages to do the impossible which is to make us love Remy and Brooke not just all over again, but even more. We cannot wait to get Remy's point of view in REMY due out November 26th.Thank you to Gallery Publishing, NetGalley and Katy Evans for the opportunity to read and review an ARC copy of Mine in exchange for my honest opinion.

It tastes an awful lot like sour apple blow pops (the candy), in liquid form. Not necessarily a bad taste for candy but as a beverage, not so good. As I continued to sip away at this drink, it became obvious that I wasn't going to be able to finish the can (I was about half ways through...). There was an unpleasant taste to this drink that I can't quite put my finger on, but I noticed that it intensified each time I returned to take another sip. Maybe something you wouldn't notice if you can swig the entire can down in a few gulps... not sure why each subsequent tasting made it less and less palatable from the sip prior, maybe the Stevia sweetener? I don't know.As for being an energy drink, one can is supposed to have the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee. I already drink an absurd amount of coffee daily to begin with... I didn't notice an energy boost from the half can I was able to drink and don't anticipate that I would have had I been able to drink the full can.

Valets were quick at both check in and out, and always asked if you needed directions.-Breakfast gets really crowded, so get there before 8:00 if you want to eat in relative peace.-The bathroom products have a cinammon scent... could be good or bad depending on your take.

As a white person, the attitudes of (most of) the white characters in this story are an embarassment to me. I know it's just a novel, but I also know (even with not having lived any further south than Virginia) that these attitudes are not fiction.The bond between Aibileen and Mae Mobley, one of the two white children she cared for, was beautifully drawn, as was Aibileen's hope for MaeMo to grow up a different kind of white woman than her mother and most other white women who inhabit the story.The balance these characters had to dance between wanting to do something that felt RIGHT--something that mattered and might help the next generation have a better life--and the fear of doing so in that racially explosive time and place was palpable throughout much of the story.In the last half of the book, I was reading while watching TV--something I don't think I've EVER done before--reading during commercials, reading in bed, reading on the porch...I felt that I HAD to keep reading. Until the last chapter or two, I was absolutely convinced that I was going to give this book a 5-star review. I was telling everyone I knew about it and recommending it heartily.But then came the ending, and I found it SO unsatisfying...especially compared to how incredibly satisfying I found the rest of the book. I may be wrong, but it screamed one of two things to me--sequel or tight deadline; i.e., either things were left unfinished because there's going to be another book or she ran out of time to bring it to the complete, fulfilling and heart-gladdening ending that this amazing story deserved.I still very much recommend the book; just perhaps not as enthusiastically as I would have 50, 100 or 400 pages ago.Edited 08/11/11 to add that I just came from seeing the movie version of The Help and I thought it was FABULOUS! The movie's director and the book's author are friends since childhood, so I was very hopeful that he would do a good job bringing this wonderful story to the screen and, in my opinion, he has.

And I'm not just talking about the uneducated masses. After I first realized that I was an atheist, and was ready to give up all the superstitions, I told two of my friends at a yearly retreat. Both have their doctorates. The next morning, for the first time, one of them initiated prayer over breakfast. In a business setting, working with the public, advertising that I'm an atheist would be economic madness. Every way that atheism is made to seem more reasonable and more acceptable is a step in the right direction, and makes it easier for me and those like me to `come out of the closet' with everyone, instead of just close friends and family. A friend of mine who is interested in politics is resigned to staying behind the scenes, because being an atheist is an unelectable characteristic.

I know I will not be in a position to take full advantage of this router's features for a while because most of my devices lack 5GHz capability but in spite of that there is no doubt it will help overall network performance. While it appears to be positioned at the modest end of the manufacturer's dual band router product line, there is nothing modest about its' usefulness.Using the resource mini-cd for the setup assistant application, basic installation was completed in less than ten minutes, not factoring in the number of individual devices I needed to reconfigure to identify the new SSID(s) and password(s). In order to create guest networking, a firmware update from the TP-LINK's website has to be installed. It should be noted the downloaded files must be extracted using WinZip or WinRAR, which might encumber some casual users. If the intention is to continue to use the Assistant app, there also appears to be another firmware update required to coincide with the other the other firmware modifications, as I discovered when I lost connectivity and couldn't restore it via the CD copy. I didn't download it as I have enough familiarity with router configuration that I had already decided to log onto the administrative page and make manual changes before I realized there was a fix available.With theoretical transfer rates up to 300Mbps over both the 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ bands which results in the published combined rate of 600Mbps, the router has already proven to be a nice step forward for my home/ home office network even though most of my activity will remain on the lower bandwidth at `g' standard. With two detachable external antennas, I would rate overall signal strength as good but not outstanding over 2.4GHZ. On the alternate band, degradation to some problematic areas in my house was evident (and expected) yet tolerable without with use of a range extender or access point.On a laptop where I swapped the existing adapter for a dual band `n' standard adapter I experienced an immediate consistent increase from the customary 36 to 46Mbps I was used to to 84Mbps via 5GHZ. That will be beneficial for streaming music and video files and networked backups to and from my media server and NAS. I'm sure most users will also be aware the 5GHZ band will only be visible on devices with dual band adapter capability and network names have to be segregated. As expected, WAN transferal over either band was not improved significantly as ISP limitations come into play there although there did appear to be a slight improvement as interference from other networks in my area is minimal on the 5GHz band.Naturally, some of us want caviar at catfish prices so it would have been great if the router had gigabit ethernet ports but it does have a USB port for networking printers and storage devices , freeing up another ethernet port for another device. It also has a power switch, a convenience absent on many devices in this price range, and wireless on/off switch which is convenient for disabling broadcasts when one is away but needs to leave the network running for some processes like scheduled backups to a networked storage device.One interesting thing was I swapped out my normal adapters for the TP-LINK WDN 3200 thinking paired products from the same manufacturer might marginally improve performance but it turned out the opposite was true. On a laptop and older desktop PC, signal strength was actually lessened by 20% I tend to believe that may be attributable to the adapters lack of external antenna. I did not try the USB type adapter with an external cord which could have impacted results by facilitating different angles.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "986c0847436a9c496c9d42fb41acb81a", "is_ques_subjective": true, "nn_asp": "opposite", "nn_mod": "true", "q_reviews_id": "b13f01813868cf623d56462017e542df", "query_asp": "option", "query_mod": "good", "ques_subj_score": 0.6000000238418579, "question": "Does the mouse have good options?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "9acef0e17eb1f5dbf6d1e23d06a04ed8", "title": "B0088CJT4U", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [0, 617], "text": ["This book was very funny", "it is good for a laugh"]}, "context": "This book was very funny, but I have to say that I don't think it is meant to be read all at once.

We've seen people who'd rather be \"Normal\" forced into the life through mere genetics in the \"X-Men\" films and we've seen a guy become a hero out of never-ending guilt in \"Spider-Man.\" Now, we see the fully-developed psychological reasons why Bruce Wayne, a man who has all the privileges of being white, rich, and gifted, would choose to live what amounts to a freak's life.Nolan and Goyer took what Tim Burton did in \"Batman\" and did it one better. Rather than giving us an artistically \"dark\" vision as to who the character is and what makes him tick, they decided to give us a plausibly \"real-world\" look into what a Gotham City would be like, right down to the gritty corruption that consumes it. We also get to see just how long it took for Bruce Wayne to become \"Batman,\" right down to where he almost takes the other road and blow away the man who murdered his parents.Christian Bale - not my first choice to play Wayne, but one can't have a really big name wear the suit. It's been proven - if a \"superstar\" wears the suit, then we don't see the character.

I got a sense of doom from him the moment he decided to become Batman, and that is the core of the character - the REAL \"person\" is Batman. \"Bruce Wayne\" has become a mask.

Leading up to the air date of the first episode of season 6, there was a ton of press coverage, promotional trailers, posters, teaser, etc. The hype was nonstop, and the fans were salivating more than ever. Expectations were ridiculously high--much higher than they ever were for the previous 5 seasons. Season 5 left us fans with many mysteries to ponder upon, and Abrams and Lindelof promised that questions would be answered.Were there any answers?I'm going to disagree with a good portion of the reviewers here and say: Yes, yes they were. Season 6 provided a lot more closure than many fans are willing to admit.I'm sure a good portion of fans who are reading this review (if any at all) are already moaning, groaning and rolling their eyes, but I ask those fans to consider something: Season 6 gave an answer to the smoke monster, the man in black, the nature of Jacob, the \"reason\" that they were all there (c'mon, that's been argued over since Season 1), the whispers, Richard Alpert's story, the effects of the incident, the sickness that consumed Danielle's crew, the overall point of the island, the wheel that Ben used, the source of the electromagnetism and what it does, the statue of Tarawet and how most of it got destroyed, the Black Rock, the origin of the others and their reason for being there, and the temple that's been talked about since the Season 3 finale. I'm not pulling these out of thin air, either. Re-watch the season. For that matter, re-watch the whole show, and then tell me that this season didn't resolve any plot threads. And let's not forget what the previous season have answered, which is much more than fans are, once again, willing to admit. Re-watching the series from the beginning has helped me realize that there really wasn't a whole lot to clear up after the show was finished, though I admit that a few plot threads were left hanging.It makes me sad to see this season criticized for not fulfilling any promises, when in fact it did, but it requires memory of everything else the series has answered, as well has subtly answered. 6 was hyped up so much that many fans (including myself) put it on some unreachable pedestal, one that no TV show could ever compare to. That's just what happens in a case like this, and it's almost inevitable. Even Abrams and Lindelof seemed to be getting rather defensive when the backlash erupted.But forget all of that for now. Let's just focus on the show. As always, there are many powerful performances by all of the lead actors. Terry O'Quinn does an outstanding, sinister performance as the man in black that has taken on the form of the deceased John Locke. The story arc of Matthew Fox's character, Jack Shephard, finally comes full circle with realizing his true destiny and rethinking everything he's done on the island. Ben (Michael Emerson) is as deceitful and evil as ever, but even he makes some highly noticeable changes midway through the season. Hurley's ability to talk to dead people is more important than ever, Richard's faith in Jacob is taken to its limits, and the entire LOST team is, once again, divided up. As usual, the show is very entertaining with spectacular performances, plot twists, drama, and none of the characters' dialogue or actions seem out of place. I'll actually admit that I felt underwhelmed at times, but thinking through everything I saw, as well as refreshing my memory on the show, has helped me to not only appreciate the season, but to love it as I love the ones that came before it.However, I can't give this season the full 5 stars. Sadly, it wasn't perfect, and despite my enjoyment, there were certainly things that could have been done better. The biggest problem with Season 6 is its pacing. Too much time was spent within the temple, and much of the time in this Egyptian maze dragged its feet, sometimes unsure of where it was going. Shoving the Dogen character down our throats and expecting us to care about him felt rather forced and unnatural. Once he was killed, it was stated that he was the only thing keeping MIB out of the temple. Why is that? I felt they could have spent even a tad of those episodes explaining the reason for this. Surely it had something to do with Jacob assigning him the role, but it was mishandled. Watching the man in black go postal on that place was certainly a Godsend for many fans, myself included. Another portion of the show was spent on the beach just preparing for things to come, as opposed to anyone actually doing anything. It felt tired and, dare I say it, uninspired. It didn't seem smart for the show to be doing this on what is supposed to be the resolution to everything. Lastly, there is the flash-sideways timeline, or \"alternate reality,\" as many fans called it. The true nature of this story line isn't understood until the very last few minutes of the finale. After much thinking and processing, it certainly helps make this side of the story a lot more enjoyable and even relevant (much more relevant than many fans say it is), it doesn't help the previous episodes that they waited entirely too long to explain it. And the two \"realities\" don't even begin to connect until the 11th episode, with only 6 more to go. It was difficult for many fans to grasp the point and relevance of this reality, though I don't mean to suggest that too many fans simply have low intellects. The MIB and Jacob-centric episode \"Across the Sea\" was not as epic and incredible as it could have and certainly had the right to have been. Some parts felt anticlimactic. However, I'm on the side of fans that really liked this episode, and it gave closure to a lot more things than most fans say it did (are you noticing a trend here?).I'll stop with the criticisms because I feel I'm representing my opinion as being a lot more negative than it actually is (it's actually quite positive). Season 6 was very well done, despite a few shortcomings. The episode that I have to give special note to is the finale, otherwise known as \"The End.\" What can I say? I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I watched in awe, and my heart was warmed more than it ever had been by the show. The \"light\" that the protector of the island is meant to protect seems to be a highly symbolic sort of plot device. I'll admit that I'm still trying to figure it out, but it certainly helps answer what the role of Jacob was, and what the role of anyone who is assigned the protector is. I can say without a doubt that the \"alternate reality\" is certainly connected to this light, and part of why it is so necessary to keep it safe. Some fans saw this as a cop-out, along with the AR, but I argue that it fits in with the show as well as everything else we've seen, if you give it a little thought.Out of all the answers that fans deny that Season 6 gave, no fan can argue that it gave a successful conclusion to each characters' story arc. Watching them evolve over so many episodes has been highly rewarding, and watching them find redemption is easily one of the best and most beautiful scenes of the entire show. I don't feel cheated whatsoever by the ending, and I don't think I would have it end any other way. I applaud the writers and producers for taking such a big risk for the end of their money maker. A new storytelling device and theme is given to each season, and season 6 was no different. It was risky, and they probably knew that some fans would be disappointed, but they created an extremely rewarding experience for this fan and many others. If you're a fan that's been following the show, you owe it to yourself to give this final piece of the puzzle a chance to fit in with the others.", "domain": "movies", "id": "705281bdc95f52daec20057b40486e23", "is_ques_subjective": true, "nn_asp": "season", "nn_mod": "different", "q_reviews_id": "0ee6fa0c74a398d4d3e5a5df25dc16df", "query_asp": "season", "query_mod": "other", "ques_subj_score": 1.0, "question": "What is your favorite season?", "question_subj_level": 4, "review_id": "302a31f7354988618d01128c8573033d", "title": "B0036EH3X4", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "action packed from beginning to end, the scene with the hulk and loki are worth the price of admission alone.", "domain": "movies", "id": "2aa8661c86da8846f2eb310f6818f7bb", "is_ques_subjective": true, "nn_asp": "scene", "nn_mod": "price worth", "q_reviews_id": "130afc943f52d732c99e127e5e737def", "query_asp": "chance", "query_mod": "slim", "ques_subj_score": 0.6000000238418579, "question": "Do you think it is a good chance to study medicine?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "6029ebd80aa414192a85f419cef65959", "title": "B001KVZ6HK", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [71], "text": ["The actors were wonderful"]}, "context": "Even if you don't like pirate movies, I recommend you seeing this one.

The blends you'll find are Carrot Curry, Beet Cabbage, Tomato Mint, Spinach Chive, Brocoli Cilantro, & Fennel Spice. The tea is 100% organic as well as non-GMO verified. Each flavor inspired from recipes around the world.I think the sampler is a very good option if interested in trying these teas out. I say that because I honestly really liked some better than others. To each their own taste, I say though. My favorite out of all six is the Spinach Chive! It leaves an aftertaste like if you were have spinach and chive dip just without the added sour cream. And the Tomato Mint was another that I liked, being the mint lover that I am. I was kinda upset I didn't like the Carrot Curry flavor more. I felt it needed to be a bit spicier and the carrot stronger in taste.The flavors of the teas aren't overly strong as one would have assumed from smelling the tea bag. I was a little shocked thinking they would have tasted more like broth or soup. I was hoping it would have been a bit stronger.

The descriptions of places and events are so rich you can perfectly imagine the characters expressions, feelings, mood, etc. In summary, you have it all, the dragons, the knights in shiny armor, the villains, the heroes and heroines, kings and queens, the supernatural and evil forces; the adventure and the unexpected.

I had purchased the Apple bluetooth keyboard for my original iPad but stopped using it after some time due to having to carry it around separately. I recently purchased the 4th generation iPad and saw this keyboard thanks to a banner ad from Amazon. I decided to give it a try.First, the keyboard itself has a great feel to it. Very easy to type and great feedback. The best feature of the keyboard has to be that it doubles as a smart case so no more carrying around a &#34;separate&#34; keyboard. It protects your iPad and attaches very nicely to it. Simply open this keyboard cover on the iPad and it slides nicely into the middle of the keyboard. It displays the iPad at a great angle for reading and fits pretty securely into the slot. The slot also seems to have a magnetic connection to it to hold the iPad more securely as well.Connecting the keyboard via bluetooth is of course very simple. It also has an on/off switch which is nice for battery preservation. It's also a better switch than what Apple's had where I couldn't easily tell if the keyboard was on/off.The keyboard charges with a standard (yes standard) USB mini connection. The cable that comes with the keyboard only hooks up to a USB port on say a computer and not a wall adapter but that was ok for me. The cable is also VERY short. But that was ok for me because I have simply been using a different USB mini power cable that plugs into the wall that I use to charge my bluetooth headset for my phone. One less charger to carry around. Also, so far the keyboard seems to hold a charge for a LONG time. I haven't run out of battery yet nor even seen the low battery indicator the keyboard claims to have. I've gone 7 days without charging and it's been fine. Now during that time I wasn't using it all day but still...I HIGHLY recommend this keyboard. The feel of the keyboard is awesome, the fact that it connects so well to iPad as a Smartcase makes it like you aren't even carrying a keyboard, and it adds protection to your iPad screen.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "1800bba14406a4cb85f2d7bc5d5a89e5", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "feel", "nn_mod": "great", "q_reviews_id": "d0ac930e0f0447382f3652a8ab04ad29", "query_asp": "feel", "query_mod": "same", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is it feel ?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "3dbb23d31f4a0941af18e13fb38a66be", "title": "B007PRHNHO", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Service and food couldn't have been better.

The power switch has been relocated to behind the mode dial. The video recording button is on the back, located on the right side of the eyepiece, similar to Canon's 'S' series cameras. Shutter noise is quiet, similar to the 40D. Image quality and color rendition on the LCD display is good, and looks similar to the 40D. The display brightness can be set manually, or the camera will adjust it automatically.Pressing the 'Q' button activates the 'Quick Control Screen', a menu where a number of settings can be conveniently adjusted. The joystick is used to toggle between functions, and settings are adjusted the normal way, using the Main and Quick Control dials. Once you get used to it, the 'Q Menu' may become your preferred method for adjusting your settings.Autofocus:As I find that Canon's nine point focusing pattern is often inadequate, the 7D's improved autofocusing system was of special interest. For those unfamiliar, the AF pattern is eight points in a diamond shaped layout with the ninth point in the middle of the diamond. The new 19 point adjustable autofocus system basically adds points in the interior of the diamond area. The actual area of coverage, does not appear to have increased. Being center weighted is understandable, but expansion beyond the diamond area is arguably more useful than just increasing the number of focus points within the diamond area.The rule of thirds is a useful guide for composing an image, however attempting to implement this rule using the diamond shaped pattern is often difficult. Say you want to focus on something in the top left quadrant of the frame. One method is to lock focus on the area, reframe, and then shoot. This works if the subject is stationary, however this method becomes more problematic for moving subjects. If only there was a focus point nearby. Increasing the concentration in the central area makes some sense, but I really wish they had expanded the overall area of autofocus coverage as well.That issue aside, performance of the new autofocus system appears to be a big improvement over the 40D and 50D. The 19 individual points, are also grouped into 5 multipoint zones, which can be selected using the Zone AF function. This feature is very useful for many applications, like sports or group shots. Shooting college basketball, focus lock using Zone AF was very good, much superior to single point focus. The high speed continuous shooting mode (8 FPS) is smooth like butter. The shutter button quite sensitive, but keeping the camera steady in burst mode takes practice.Remote Triggering and Wireless Flash:A very convenient feature that was a long time coming to Canon's prosumer line, is the ability to remotely trigger the 7D using Canon's RC-1 remote, or other inexpensive remotes. The 7D can also be triggered by Pocket Wizards, via the N3 terminal. The integral flash is essential, and the 7D also has the capability to wirelessly trigger compatible Canon speedlights, eliminating the need for the ST-E2 transmitter, and makes creative flash photography more convenient.Live View, Video, and Memory:Photography via live view mode, is similar to a point and shoot, although the 7D is a little heavy to be holding in front of your face. As claimed by Canon, the image taken seems to be 100% of what appears in the LCD display. I use live view for rough framing when the camera is on a tripod. For HD video a fast card is a must, Canon recommends using a CF card with a transfer rate of 8MB/second. Shooting video is simple, though the results can be kind of spotty. Check YouTube for video reviews of the 7D, and examples of videos shot with the 7D. Picture quality can be quite good, although skin tones may not be accurate, and AF is not continuous. You will need ample memory to shoot video, as a 4GB card holds about 12 minutes of content. For images at highest image quality (RAW + JPEG), the camera reads that a 32 GB card will hold about 960 images, an 8 GB card about 240, and a 4 GB card about 125.ISO:As the 40D tops off at ISO 1600, the 7D's ability to shoot up to ISO 6400 is mind-blowing. The noise in test shots at ISO 4000 and above, were not bad. I rarely exceed ISO 800, but it is something I will now look into further.LP-E6 Battery:Canon's LP-E6 batteries have a serial number, and the 7D will keep track of the battery's power level, and number of shots taken. Canon continues to take measures to discourage the use of third party products. Non-Canon versions of the LP-E6 battery will work in the 7D, but are not recognized, and read as `empty' on the battery meter, with no data available. Having used non-Canon BP-511 batteries for years in various Canon SLR's, without any problems, I do not believe that they are inferior or dangerous. You can pay $60 for the Canon LP-E6 if you wish, but you can get generic LP-E6 batteries for as low as $10.In these hard economic times, value and quality are even more important. The 7D does cost more than the 40D and 50D when they debuted, but it is worth it. The 7D is better built, has many more standard features, and produces better images. It appears that Canon is very serious about competing with Nikon, which should benefit users of both brands. It will take some time for most users to begin tap into the potential this camera offers.

Even though I wasn't actively looking for a keyboard, it met two requirements I had for an HTPC keyboard to replace the existing one.1 - The mouse is not targeted to right handers. As a left hander, I am continually frustrated by Mice that are unusable for me.2 - Range - I had been using a MS Laser 5000 keyboard and mouse on the HTPC. The range was so limited that one had to sneak up on the computer to get things to work. The advertised range for the Wireless Desktop 3000 was 30 feet. That caught my attention so I purchased one and sure enough if works fine from across the room. That in itself makes the purchase worthwhile.They also advertise that the mouse works on any surface and it seems to. I can sit on the sofa and use the mouse on the arm of the sofa with no problems. However, the 5000 mouse is equally responsive on any surface, it just doesn't have the range.Unfortunately, the keyboard design has changed from the Wireless 5000. The key layout has changed enough that I wouldn't want to have to switch between the 3000 and 5000 for normal use (both of my desktops use the 5000) but for the HTPC where we don't do a lot of typing the new keyboard is fine.The ESC, function, PrtScrn, ScrLock, and Pause keys have been miniaturized as have all of the dedicated function keys. The keys are also aligned straight across the keyboard as opposed to the curved design of the 5000. One would thing that the ergonomics of keyboards would be pretty well understood by now but we keep changing them with every new iteration.From my perspective, if you like your current keyboard and mouse there is no reason to make an impulse purchase (I bought mine at Sam's on impulse mainly for the range). However if you need a new keyboard on have an old mouse that's finicky of some surfaces, this keyboard may well suit your needs.Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000", "domain": "electronics", "id": "1cb566cb91b3d0e8cc116ab5d9a247e5", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "mouse", "nn_mod": "responsive", "q_reviews_id": "35ecf2bb7757fd64e723f1b2eb41b17a", "query_asp": "receiver", "query_mod": "small", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How to receiver size?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "9d2a2078970dfbb2791bcad9c311560e", "title": "B001S4OTS6", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "In a nutshell, The Name of the Wind recounts the tale of Kvothe, a young man destined to become the most powerful wizard the world has ever seen. It begins with Kvothe's childhood years, first as a member of a traveling troupe of musicians and artists, and then as a street urchin forced to fend for himself in a violent environment. Later, the story shifts to his adolescence, at a time when he is admitted to the University, renowned school of magic.Reading along, I found the structure of the story a little odd. The better part of the novel is comprised of Kvothe's back story, with only a few scenes occurring in \"real time.\" Having never encountered something like it, I discussed it with Betsy Wollheim. She did shine some light on the matter, and it turns out that Rothfuss' first trilogy will focus on the main character's past, with occasional tantalizing hints of things to come. A second trilogy will then recount Kvothe's \"present\" tale.The Name of the Wind is told in a first person narrative. Hence, other than those \"real time\" segments told in the third person, most of the book is told from Kvothe's perspective. Those who have a problem with single-POV narratives similar to that of Robin Hobb's The Farseer and The Tawny Man trilogies, consider yourselves warned. The main danger in using the first person narrative is that the entire story rests on the shoulder of a single character. If you like Kvothe, terrific. If you don't, that's where it gets tricky. I had no problem with that facet of the novel, but I'm acutely aware that some readers don't care much for the first person perspective.The worldbuilding doesn't play a big role in this debut. And yet, Rothfuss hints at a much vaster depth, hopefully to be explored in future sequels. The author has an eye for details, and the story does come alive as you turn the pages. The magic system appears to be well thought of and interesting, and I'm eager to learn more about it.The Name of the Wind is a character-driven book. As a first person narrative, it can't be anything but that. The supporting cast is composed of a relatively small number of characters, which is rather rare for a book of this size. I'm looking forward to learning more about them in the upcoming installments.The novel suffers from only one flaw -- a flaw shared by various Daw books: it's too long. I feel that Rothfuss' attention to details slows the pace in several portions of the book. I feel that some scenes could have been truncated and others excised without the readers missing out on any major plotlines. In my opinion, this would quicken the rhythm and improve the overall quality of the book.Unlike some debuts that are not easily accessible -- Hal Duncan's Vellum and Steven Erikson's Gardens of the Moon come to mind -- I'm persuaded that The Name of the Wind can appeal to both neophytes and long-time fans of the genre. As such, it's similar to both Brandon Sanderson's Elantris and Joe Abercrombie's The Blade Itself in that regard. It's also a throwback work, which brought fantasy novels likes Raymond E. Feist's Magician and David Eddings' Pawn of the Prophecy to mind.Although a bit overlong, The Name of the Wind is a solid and ambitious effort. Two years ago I would have claimed that it could well be the debut of the year. But Hal Duncan and Scott Lynch have forced us to look at debuts in a different way. Still, Patrick Rothfuss wrote an auspicious debut, and I'm curious to discover the rest of Kvothe's tale.[...]", "domain": "books", "id": "6b944fa9234a727566503757416cbfa8", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "story", "nn_mod": "alive", "q_reviews_id": "340e147f9161f00a4c0a02adb77bf111", "query_asp": "life", "query_mod": "wonderful", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "What you can infer about life from this story ?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "a799244ca521c22fb884206626d22ffc", "title": "0575081384", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [116], "text": ["The headphones are comfortable"]}, "context": "I read a lot of the reviews for this product before I bought these, and I have to agree with every positive review.

We were greeted by a hostess who told us that the wait time to get a table is about 30 minutes. When we told her there are plenty of empty tables, she said that there are people ahead of us on the waiting list, when clearly there was nobody around waiting to be called! As a matter of fact, we saw a guy who came and told her that they never called his name and he got angry when she said she had called his name and there was no response.My boyfriend did not like her attitude and neither did I.

Writing Style/Readability: The writing style is really simple, but this IS a book directed towards younger kids after all. Plus, it's a better style for an action novel as it doesn't belabor the point for 20 pages by describing every bead of sweat and sound in the forest. As for \"readability\" I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN.2. Plot: this is one of the things that made The Hunger Games really hit home for me. It was fast paced and action-packed and also \"wonderfully predictable\" in that when you really want something to happen, it does.3. Characters: All of them were pretty plain with not much going on underneath the surface, but not in a way that was annoying or unenjoyable. The heroine is full of nothing but, of course, moral fiber, her only \"flaw\" being that she has a fiery temper which is played to be endearing. She's also very humble of her abilities and totally oblivious to Peeta and Gale's affections for her (yet oh so observant on the battlefield) which is usually extremely annoying, but the other aspects of the novel made up for it.4. Overall Originality: It goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that nothing like this has been done before (and I don't mean in a broad sense about totalitarian government, blah blah). The author added a few futuristic elements to the story with the genetically engineered animals and all that, but not such an alarming amount that would distance the reader from the story.5. Value (was it thought provoking?): Didn't really produce any life changing epiphanies.6. Enjoyment: I loved this book and that is the reason I give it 5 stars. I value books more for how much I enjoyed them personally rather than for how well written or how thought provoking they were, although those are certainly key factors. Ultimately, though, it comes down to if I would want to read this book again or recommend it to friends, and in that aspect, this book is 100% in that category.Also...PG-13Violence in the book isn't graphic in description, but is in concept (teenagers killing each other without empathy and all that, but most video games are no better), but there's no mention of sex (as you'd think there'd be in such a brutal society). I'm glad there isn't, though because this is a book directed towards young teens and senseless sex is obnoxious in any book.The Bottom Line: You'll be missing out if you don't read this book! =]", "domain": "books", "id": "ea6a0625c7ccfab435dfb26c721b1ba0", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "writing style", "nn_mod": "simple", "q_reviews_id": "4574fbaf003286b59aae90fc14ef4153", "query_asp": "child", "query_mod": "more", "ques_subj_score": 0.375, "question": "Do you have any other children?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "110b63154d5330ff1d2ee93e1860659b", "title": "0439023483", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "\"Back to the Future\" has gotta be the very best movie of the 80's. For anyone under 30, you know that the 1980's is the new 1940's. This is the golden age of cinema for the MTV Generation. And that just makes \"Back to the Future\" so much more special because even with tons of other great feature films, it still stands out.The movie has so many great lines and catchphrases, such as, \"Hello, hello, anyone home? Think McFly, think.\" I can not so fondly remember how my teenage uncles used to imitate Biff and knock on mine and my brother's head just like Biff did to George. Another great line, \"history's gonna change.\"I also love the entire cast. From beginning to end the cast is totally perfect. My favorite of course is Michael J. Fox as Marty. He was the perfect actor to play this role because he was so cute and cool and brave. (BTW, can you believe they were originally gonna use Eric Stoltz! Can you say: MISCAST!!) I also love Crispin Glover (Geroge McFly, although in the 2nd one he was played by Jeffrey Weissman) who was so completely funny. Christopher Lloyd as the Doc was perfect. He totally reminded me of his character from \"Taxi.\" Rounding out the cast is Lea Thompson (Lorraine, Marty's mom) and Thomas F. Wilson (as the unforgettable Biff Tannen.) I also like both of the Jennifers (Claudia Wells was in the first one) (Elisabeth Shue was in the second 2 movies.) My favorite Jennifer was Claudia Wells but she refused to do the sequels because of \"personal issues.\" Maybe she wanted more money like Crispin Glover? Oh and I also really liked Wendie Jo Sperber (may she rest in peace) (who played Marty's sister, Linda.) I especially liked how Linda took the curlers out of her hair at the dining room table, that's so 80's!!Instead of going on about the storylines and plots for each of these movies (that the entire world has seen) I thought it would be more fun to describe some of the old and otherwise archaic technologies, culture and styles that were displayed in the \"future\" Hill Valley of 2015. It made the movie appear somewhat dated, but that's why it's an entertaining 80's film.Payphones - There was a clear shot of one during the daytime scene when Marty left the cafe. I can't remember the last time I've even seen a payphone, let alone used one (maybe 10 years?) Last year the country's biggest phone company announced that because of the advent of cell phones they were getting out of the payphone business.Picture Frames - There was a ton of these all over the McFly's end table. Although not obsolete yet, most agree that within the next few years we will begin to see less and less of these because digital frames will be much easier to access.Bulletin Flyers - These were displayed outside of the cafe, near the dumpster. This is something else that I can't remember seeing for years and years. Probably because of electronic networks like Craigslist.Sales Staff that \"wait on\" customers - The saleslady in the \"antique\" store was totally waiting on Marty and trying to get him to buy something. The small \"mom & pop\" stores of yesterday are nearly totally gone. And those huge department stores that replaced them do not have the time, energy or patience to wait on anyone.Faxes - Marty's home had fax machines everywhere (even inside the closet!) First of all, did you see how antiquated the print on the faxes looked? So 1985. For the home consumers, faxes and telexes are about as useful as Morse code. And for businesses they will be a thing of the past within the next 5 to 10 years for obvious reasons.Mailboxes - There was one in the \"center\" of Hill Valley (next to the USA Today newspaper dispenser.) With electronic billing, text messages and cell phones we are mailing less and less. \"Snail mail\" will never completely evaporate, but these old-fashioned-looking mailboxes are becoming a thing of the past.Green Screen Door - This was the door that old Biff scampered out of before he got in the taxi to follow Doc and Marty. You'd think that in 2015 they would have nicer looking doors? This one looks like something straight out of the 1950's.Oversized Earnings - The saleslady in the \"antique\" store was wearing this godawful pair of yellow earrings that are roughly the size of a Jr. cheeseburger from Wendy's. And the old Jennifer also had on a pair of these large things on her ears. Ear-jewelry like this has not been in style since \"The Golden Girls\" were on TV.Wallpaper - The McFly's home was covered in this. This is something else that is totally out of style. Last year when I was helping a friend redo her kitchen we went to a popular home improvement store to get some border and were told that they stopped manufacturing this years ago....The entire \"Back to the Future Trilogy\" is beyond perfect. And, the music is so fast and funny. Huey Lewis & The News. My goodness, talk about bringing back the dead. The Trilogy is not too much and not too little. You know how some movies can drag on and on and on (like this review?) that's not the case here. Michael J. Fox was a brand-new man in each of these movies. Of course the first one is the very best. But I enjoyed \"Back to the Future Part II\" immensely (and Part III, as wel.) As any child of the 80's can attest to, this movie was such a hugely anticipated event. \"Back to the Future Part II\" was almost like a religious experience because no one could live without it. Everyone has to see all 3 of these movies. Even if the \"Back to the Future Trilogy\" had Skippy, Elyse, Mallory & Tina Yothers it still couldn't be more 80's!

And now I'm a huge book lover. But I don't think that was the reason. The author has the unique ability to draw someone in and before they realize what has happened they are hooked.The story begins with the narrator telling the reader how he knows the main character. I don't recall him mentioning his name, but I'll tell you. His name is death. And he tells about the first time he met Liesel when she was just a little girl. Death comes to claim the souls of the people as they die and that is where he meets her for the first time. It's also when she steals her first book.The time is set at the beginning of Hitler and takes you to the end of the war and through the journey of Liesel, the book thief.This book isn't just about a war or books. It's about the complexity of humanity.We can be so evil and so cruel. But we can also be so warm and beautiful.I think the words of Death at end sum up so much -\"I wanted to tell the book thief many things, about beauty and brutality. But what could I tell her about those things that she didn't already know? I wanted to explain that I am constantly overestimating and underestimating the human race-that rarely do I ever simply estimate it. I wanted to ask her how the same thing could be so ugly and so glorious, and it's words and stories so damning and brilliant.None of those things, however, came out of my mouth.All I was able to do was turn to Liesel Meminger and tell her the only truth I truly know. I said it to the book thief and I say it now to you.I am haunted by humans.\"I don't typically like war books and I hate to cry. But this was both for me and I loved it.

It had great special effects, but everything else was just... ok. The thing that made the first Star Wars films great is that they are extremely well rounded and balanced, and succeed in all of the areas. This movie attempted to recreate that previous success, but didn't quite make it.In this space-age tale, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui Gon Jin (two jedis from the Jedi council, one of which is already well known) try to end a trade dispute which has resulted in a blockade going up around the planet known as &quot;Naboo&quot;. However, after an assassination attempt, they are forced to flee to Naboo, where they meet some interesting people, including Princess Amidala (played by Natalie Portman). From there they make a desperate attempt to visit a political council on the faraway planet of Coruscant. On the way they stop off on Tatooine and end up picking up Anakin Skywalker, a.k.a. Darth Vader. He's much younger, though, and not at all menacing.After the entire party reaches Coruscant, they do some things (sorry, I'm low on big words right now), and eventually decide to head back to save the planet (Naboo). The movie has some good scenes towards the end, and the lightsaber duel is awesome- it's like acrobatics with a little bloodthirst.The reason this movie doesn't quite make it is that the storyline is only marginally good, the characters aren't developed enough, and frankly, Jar Jar Binks ends up as one of those characters you just wish would be put out of their misery with a sledge hammer... However, the movie does have great special effects, and offers a look into Star Wars history. No, this movie is not as good an achievment as the earlier movies in the series, but it is worth seeing.

I'm not going to say great but it's pretty good for the price. I did some extensive homework before I bought this as I was looking for a smart tv that offered an alternative to hooking it up to several components for a guest bedroom. Instead I liked it so much that I ended up putting this in my bedroom and switching it out with a slightly older Sylvania flat screen I had (great picture) for the guest room. The slim, sleekness of it takes a little getting used to in terms of the screen- you have a thinner frame and more screen to look at if that makes sense. The apps and streaming are pretty good for what you get and Vizio is constantly updating to add more apps. There is a slight learning curve when trying to link it up with your wifi however I found that by turning it off & on after the initial info is entered helped in terms of getting the tv to connect. It took two tries for me but afterwards it was smooth sailing. Again the Netflix, Hulu and other apps are good. There's some interesting freebie channel apps where you can watch old tv shows in there too at no cost so that's kind of nice to have. My favorite feature of this television hands down is the ability to plug in a usb drive and play multiple types of video files automatically without having to hook it up to a PC or DVD player. You can also play mp3 files and look at photos, etc. but I was really impressed by the number of files it would play without too much of a problem. The remote that comes with the TV is a sore spot here and I'll tell you why. They provide you with a smart tv that allows you to access online streaming and other applications yet you get this remote that is more for a basic TV with no buttons such as for launching Netflix or other hotkeys for the streaming apps it offers. This is where Vizio literally Cheapens out this model. The remote is also small, lengthy and complicated in terms of a million tiny keys. There is also no keyboard. You would think that a smart tv would come equipped with a remote that offered a keyboard yet it does not. I realized this is part of the reason why this tv is a bit of a bargain compared to other smart TVs out there. At any rate, I resolved this by replacing the remote with the VIZIO XRV1TV Qwerty keyboard remote (bought here on Amazon for about $12). I know this is not ideal for some because the idea is that you get a brand new tv and you shouldn't have to spend extra $$ on an additional remote however I recommend it in this case as the little cheap universal that comes with this set will drive you mad. You really do want a remote with a Qwerty Keyboard on the back as this will come in handy if/when you do a search on youtube or Netflix or Hulu--you won't be there forever trying to navigate letters on-screen with the up/down remote toggle keys (eyes rolling). Now for the rest of this thing- it's got great picture and some pretty good choice settings for gaming, etc. You just have to get in there and explore it. Some people have complained that the picture looks dimmer than when they saw it on the showroom floor however I just found that I adjusted the controls and it seems to be fine. I believe also that this set has an automatic sensor built-in that adjusts the brightness of the screen depending on the level of light in the room. I have not played with it enough to find out for sure whether or not this is something you can turn off or adjust. There are only two HDMI connections and that can be bothersome to some. For me this wasn't an issue as I don't always hook this up to a PC however it was good to have it hooked up to my cable box but honestly two connections was fine for me. Gamers and PC enthusiasts may get irritated at this small amount of HDMI connections so buyer beware there. Again, this was one of the cheapest smart tv models out there with good reviews that I found so i'm not too surprised it lacks a few things. Some folks have complained at the slowness of the TV to power on and I will say it takes about 20-30 seconds which can get on your nerves. All I can say there is to just have some patience and resist the urge to keep hitting the power switch as I learned the hard way you might actually activate a hard-reset of the television by doing that. That brings me to mention a safety feature the tv has built-in in the event of a power surge or storm. I came home one evening after a wicked rain storm to find the tv buzzing at me every few seconds after I'd turned it on. It kept making a noise similar to those you hear when a weather bulletin flashes on your screen from your local news, etc. I couldn't get the TV to stop doing this so after trying to adjust the settings for a good half hour and finding no solution to this I did some research on the net and found this was a result of a built in sensor that is designed to protect the TV from shorting out if an electrical surge occurs (which apparently did). So the solution to this was to power it off and unplug it from the power source for a good 20 minutes. Once we did this, it came right back on and adjusted to normal as if nothing had happened. Overall it's a very interesting unit with good picture and a fairly good amount of &#34;smart&#34; apps for an entry level smart tv.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "b0e2fac4615e0a95f3f3fe46f45dacef", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "remote", "nn_mod": "small", "q_reviews_id": "e313962ac7eb9bc3aace9572d5f7f231", "query_asp": "remote", "query_mod": "functional", "ques_subj_score": 0.20000000298023224, "question": "How is the remote?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "716094f88d8a959cf8c908cdab8ebd58", "title": "B0096YOQRY", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [18, 18], "text": ["the staff was very pleasant", "the staff was very pleasant"]}, "context": "Went there today, the staff was very pleasant and we were seated quickly.

She took away the dish and apologized. After a bit of wait, eating their fries was delicious, I finally received a cooked Insomnia burger. It was delicious.

The service is top notch. The food is exquisite. We had a 7 course meal, with wine pairing. Everything was unbelievably delicious. I dined with two other people, each having a 7 course meal. Not one dish was the same as the other - everyone had a different meal, so we literally had 21 different dishes in one night . All of us loved everything we ate. My favourite was the chefs award winning tuna. I will never forget this night. I look forward to celebrating my wedding here.Update as of Sep 2017: i have now dined here 3 times, and after last night's experience, I have to say this is by far the best restaurant I've been to. Period. It was so nice to see familiar faces- our waiter Rob from the first time we ate at George, a year ago, served us again last night. The manager, Mark, came by to greet us last night, as he set up a little wine tasting session before our wedding day one year ago. Our other waiter, Justin, who served us on our wedding day last year, remembered us and talked about some of the fun details he remembers from our wedding. And Shana , our wedding coordinator, stopped by to say hello. I can't tell you enough how much this restaurant left an impression on me and my husband.

It was my second visit to SFO but the first for everyone else. With 2 small children we wanted to stay somewhere central with easy access to transport. We were not disappointed from that respect with the Handlery. Shops galore and the cable car practically at the door step.We were in a club room so after checking in, the easiest access from and to our room was from the O'Farrell St entrance. There were renovations being undertaken at the time we stayed but we were unaffected aside from the fact we had to walk through the basement to get from the lobby to our room on the other side of the hotel.Check in was easy and staff very friendly. Our room was comfortable. Even though there were 4 of us and we had a lot of luggage given we were travelling with 2 small children, we did not feel too cramped and it was useful having a small dressing table just outside the bathroom. Our room looked over O'Farrell St and we did get a bit of street noise, including music and singing from the buskers until about 11pm to 12am but it did not really bother us and our children were able to sleep through it. Our room was just outside the lift though and they were noisy. But again we were not too bothered by it but be aware of it if you a light sleeper and noise sensitive. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom small but adequate.Our coffee maker was not working but was replaced very promptly with a new one. Our room missed being serviced on one day we stayed but clean towels were delivered to us quickly once we called for them. We also got a letter of apology from John Handlery regarding this in response to a feedback form we completed. With our 1 year old we needed to get boiled water and to be able to heat up food from time to time and the staff were very accommodating about that. We were able to access the staffroom to use the microwave.We did not find the concierge very friendly or approachable but the bell hops were very helpful and accommodating.We intended to, but did not get around to trying out the Daily Grill but there are lots of cafes and restaurants close by to try and many at reasonable prices. For breakfast Loris Diner is a good choice (we went back a few times) as is Cafe Mason. Both are just around the corner from the hotel. We had breakfast at Lefty O'Doulls one day but would not back. Food was below average compared to what else was nearby and service was not great. We tried to get into Dotties True Blue Cafe on Jones St given great reviews it got on TripAdvisor but there was a long line outside so we did not wait as we had to 2 children who were very hungry at that stage.We did a lot of walking and our 5 year old managed to keep up pretty well. If you are travelling with kids, Zeum and the Exploratorium are a must. Zeum is in walking distance (about 15 mins) and the Exploratorium accessible by bus. We went to the Aquarium which was good but not really that big and to be honest, if you have been to Kelly Tarlton's in Auckland, the Sydney Aquarium or the Aquarium in Vancouver, you won't really miss anything by giving the Pier 39 Aquarium a miss. You may want to go in any event though if you have kids as they do have some touching pools where you can touch starfish and some fish.We bought the 7 day City Pass which was very handy, and definitely worthwhile if you intend to hop on and off the cable car as otherwise the one ride or daily passes are relatively expensive.The cable car turning area at Powell and Market Streets always seemed to be busy with long lines. It seemed less of a wait at the cable car turning area at the end of the Powell Hyde line.Catch the cable car to the top of Lombard St - it stops literally right at the top where pretty gardens are - rather than approach from the bottom as walking down is definitely easier than walking up! It's easy to catch the cable car back to the city from the bottom of the street.Book your Alcatraz tickets at least a couple of days in advance even in the low season. It was not peak season when we went but we still had to wait for a couple of days before there were available spaces.We did a Wok Wizz walking tour of Chinatown - our guide was very informative and gave us lots of good tips of places to go for people wanting to purchase or see particular things. The tour included a stop at the fortune cookie factory on Ross Street (I think) where we could see how the cookies were made, sample them and of course buy. It was USD5 for a big bag. Very yummy. If you are heading to Chinatown and looking for the more authentic stores, ie the ones where the locals buy their fresh fruit and vegetables and groceries etc, head to Stockton St and Jackson St. Grant St, the street with the Chinatown gate is more for tourists. Cheap T-shirts galore - about USD2 or 3 each. Ghiradelli Square and Hyde St Pier is a good place to spend a relaxing morning or afternoon, especially if you are interested in historic ships and maritime matters. It is also where the Ghiradelli chocolate factory and shops are. Although we had 7 days in SFO, we took things reasonably slowly since we were travelling with kids, but we could probably have easily spent another few days, or even a week, to see some of the other things we didn't get to!One other thing to be aware of is that it is pretty cool in SFO, apparently at any time of the year. Even though it was mid Spring when we went, we found it at times cooler than it was back in Auckland (where it was mid Autumn). Layers are definitely recommended and I would make sure you have a fleece or similar, especially for the kids if you are going to be down near hthe pier/wharf areas. Having said that, if you forget to pack them, there are plenty of places to buy them at relatively cheap prices.For non-Americans and people who have not been to the States before, it might be useful to know that pharmacies like Walgreens, which can be found all over central city, sell almost anything that you would want from a supermarket at reasonable prices so a good place to go to stock up on bottled water, snacks and the like.", "domain": "tripadvisor", "id": "37e20408fc5fbeab71383e428fc540df", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "staff", "nn_mod": "very accommodate", "q_reviews_id": "23dd8b07494586560229d6074ef5ddb2", "query_asp": "bellman", "query_mod": "helpful", "ques_subj_score": 0.5, "question": "How many bellman does the shirt have?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "tripadvisor_review_10129", "title": "usa_san francisco_handlery_union_square_hotel", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [189], "text": ["The steak is delicious"]}, "context": "All I can say is wow!

Considering the price, I feel like this is a no-brainer purchase if you enjoy streaming shows from Netflix, clips on Youtube, and/or movies out of Google's store.Setup was a little more complicated than I was expecting. I have a dual-band router, both with the same hidden SSID. The Chromecast has an option to enter in your hidden SSID so it seemed like there'd be zero issue. Entered it correctly, verified, and it just couldn't find my network. I went back and tried a few times, thinking I must have been fat-fingering a button. No luck. I un-hid my 5ghz SSID, tried connecting, no luck. It only worked after exposing the SSID on both 2.4 and 5ghz bands before it would connect. Somewhere on the device page it says it does work with 2.4ghz hidden SSIDs, and I may try re-naming that band and hiding the 5ghz again. But I hear that's not actually too terrible a thing to break through if somebody's actually seeking to get in so I might not even worry about it.Anyway, once setup, it's worked great with my HTC One. Finding content through Netflix, Google Play, and Youtube on your phone is so much more convenient and intuitive than searching on the apps on your TV, or 360, etc. Basically - any box where you have to fumble with a remote to do searching and navigation, this is better than. You kick off a movie/clip, cast it to your TV, and the phone is free to do whatever else you want while the content plays. At any time you can get back into the casting app and pause/resume content. Super slick.I tried out the casting extension on my chrome browser, and it works about like you'd expect. You can cast a tab, and all content on that tab is sent to your TV. Works reasonably well for me, and I can definitely see the use cases (photo sharing, watching things you can't get to through the other mediums you have). I tried streaming a movie through my Amazon Prime account, and while it worked, the audio wasn't 100% synced up. And of course if you want it full-screen, you have to give up your laptop while the movie plays. Also - my laptop (retina MBP) got really hot, and really noisy. My recommendation would be to not expect to use this feature on a regular basis for streaming content.One other downside I noticed is that while casting a netflix movie, the netflix screen takes up the entirety of my lock screen. I received a phone call, and the phone was ringing but the caller information was missing, as were the 'Answer' and 'Ignore' buttons. Had to \"back\" out of the netflix info (which is just weird on the lock screen to have to do) before they showed up. Google Play Movies did not have this problem, yet still allowed you to pause/resume from the lock screen.Anyway - I really can't recommend this thing enough. It isn't perfect, but it's also not expensive enough to expect perfection. If you like Netflix, Youtube, and Google Play content to be on your TV, this is the easiest and cheapest way to get it there. If you have other ways to get it there, this is still a worthy investment as it's infinitely more pleasing to use than a TV-remote based application.Very, very pleased.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "856b0fff7f3870debba3125970432079", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "way", "nn_mod": "other", "q_reviews_id": "007b63098ca9b5e6b25c6716cfe93020", "query_asp": "video", "query_mod": "choppy", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the video quality for this gaming system?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "79019253aa6523f566c4d604de6b46f8", "title": "B00DR0PDNE", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [168], "text": ["the food was divine"]}, "context": "Glorious!

It was mostly told in chronological order (although I was never quite sure when things were taking place), but there was no overall narrative. It was more like short stories all about the same family. That said, I found the short stories fascinating and I really enjoyed reading the book.The beginning of the book, Jeannette's younger years, are a lot more lighthearted and fun than the later years. Even though they are extremely poor and her parents pretty much leave the kids to their own devices the parents still seem like good people. When Jeannette's father can't afford a Christmas he gives her the planet Venus instead. There are some terrible moments like three-year-old Jeannette getting burned while cooking hot dogs and having to be hospitalized for six weeks and receive skin grafts, but for the most part it's fairly lighthearted.Eventually the family moves into Jeannette's recently deceased grandmother's house in Phoenix. I would say this is the point where it starts to go downhill. Her father drinks more and more and the family has little money. Her parents don't believe in locking doors so bums sometimes break into their house, Jeannette wakes up one night to a bum inappropriately touching her. Eventually her mother has had enough and she decides to move the family to Jeannette's father's hometown in West Virginia. At first they live with Jeannette's grandmother who never leaves the house, is a raging alcoholic, and hates children. After Jeannette and her older sister stop the grandmother from molesting their brother the children are banished to the basement. Soon after, the family moves into a run down shack on the outside of town that has no electricity or running water.I'll leave the description at that, obviously Jeannette makes her way out of West Virginia to become a successful journalist. As sad as the story is there's also a lot of hope. The way the kids stick together is really special and there were moments where I had tears on my eyes. And while Jeannette writes about her parents with a lot of affection, it's difficult for me to like them. Yes her father was a alcoholic and her mother no doubt should have been on medication, but her mother did sometimes hold down jobs. But ultimately she just seemed not to want to work, which if she's mentally ill, which she surely is, I understand, but there's an instance where Jeannette and her brother find a two-caret diamond ring on their land in West Virginia and rather than selling it to buy food or fix the house their mother decides to keep it because their father pawned her original wedding ring. That to me is just inexcusable.But ultimately it's not on me to pass judgement. I actually read this book because my mom read it and couldn't believe I never had. She told me it would remind me of growing up with her. It didn't (for the most part), but everyone's family is obviously a little crazy.

Vitamins A, B3, B5, B6, B12, and C have been \"added\", along with Taurine, Magnesium, electrolytes, and caffeine. Each serving squeeze flavors an 8 oz glass of water, and there are 24 servings in a bottle (or perhaps not - see below).To put this enhancer in perspective, a typical 1oz serving of espresso packs a punch of 40 to 75 mg of caffeine; 40 mg is what this water enhancer provides in an 8 oz glass. The added benefit with the squeeze is that you don't have to add calories via cream and sugar, and you've got a few vitamins thrown in as well. Another plus, is the convenience of simply squeezing in the flavor and caffeine.However, taste wise, the fruit punch tastes like sugar free gum. So yes, it's got that weird phony aftertaste that makes you screw up your face after drinking it. Another problem comes from the squeeze method per serving.

Lucas and his team took puppets, plastic models, and so forth, and made a story that touched millions of people. Lucas himself once said that special effects are there just to help you tell a story. When he changed something that enhanced the experience, like most of his changes in Special Edition Empire-it was okay.

The description provided by Amazon, the seller, was rather lack-luster. Here is my summary of my thoughts-and-impression.1) Ordered Oct 22, arrived Oct 242) Ordered four (4), got four3) Arrived in a rather big box with contents flopping though no visible damage - combined with another order4) Flash Drive includes unmentioned SanDisk SecureAccess software (AES-128bit) that is a little out-of-date. Should be at least AES-256bit and should use FAT32 at a minimum with NTFS preferred. It is a USB2 device.5) Testing flash drive (Win):a) root directory has two visible folders (club-application and SanDiskSecureAccess)b) root directory has two executable files (RunClubSanDisk.exe and RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exe)c) root directory has a hidden file autorun.inf (can be opened with Notepad if curious)d) flash drive packaging indicates WinXP, Vista, and 7 are supported as well as Mac OS X v10.5+e) Mac users needing security are directed to the SanDisk website's SecureAccess page (URL will be censored by Amazon) for downloadf) The club application was of absolutely no interest and the associated folders/files were deleted. It is one of those, \"Get special offers from SanDisk partners\" RPIA's.g) The SanDisk SecureAccess Quick Start Guide is a PDF located in the SanDiskSecureAccess folder. If the SanDisk SecureAccess process is something that has never been used, this provided guide would be a must to read - it is short.h) If I recall, correctly, the, unwritten, MAXIMUM, vault size is 4gb which is sufficiently large to hold the contents of one (1) DVD. If compressed (ZIP'd) files are written to the flash drive, it is often possible to squeeze more than 4gb of uncompressed files into the 4gb vault space; however, this is way to subjective to give any \"reasonable\" percentage since compression depends upon the compression software and the file content being compressed (e.g. video, text, spreadsheet, document, database, etc.).i) Normally, I delete all of these provided tools. If I change my mind at some future date, I can go to the SanDisk website and download the SecureAccess software. (If there is the curious streak, the older U3 software is also available that is more userfriendly and more out-of-date and does NOT use the \"vault\" concept. Get both the install and the uninstall software if you think about using it. BTW, you are, of course on your own though the support folks will sometimes answer questions.)j) If you do use the provided tools, do MAKE SURE the Closing your private vault instructions, on page 8 (English) are followed. The flash like any plug-and-play device will mostly always be unaffected by just yanking from the USB port; however, the more important the information stored, the greater the chance the once-in-a-million \"oops\" corruption will strike.k) There is a place on the drive to attach a lanyard, or string, to keep loss at a minimum. I am thinking the cap is a gonner since it does not fit all that securely; however, this comment in no way obviates the intended purpose of the device and how it works. Just doNOT use peanut butter as a place to stick the drive to keep it from getting lost (you are going to have to figure out the reasoning for this comment).l) Did they work?It was curious that the thumbnail icon for the flash drives was that for the ClubSanDisk and not the SanDisk SecureAccess when it appeared. It seemed to have a great deal of difficulty in displaying after the longer than expected recognition and driver-installation. Specificially, the autorun.inf was configured for the ClubSanDisk.I changed my autorun.inf to the following (if you choose to do so, YOU do it at your own \"RISK!\"):[autorun]action=SecureAccessopen=RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exeicon=RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exeWhat does this mean if the icon does not show? Well, you may have to \"guess\" which drive letter is associated with your flash drive - no biggie; but, rather annoying. For some reason, I got noticably slower access and usage, \"IF\" I had a USB3 device plugged into one of the available USB2 ports at the same time.m) Getting the little drive out of the packaging was an interesting exercise in frustration. The first one I could extract \"almost\" using the cut line indicated on the packaging. The second one required a little more effort since the cap was stuck to the packaging which required major surgery to get the clear plastic unstuck from the cap. The third flash was a little easier to extract from the packaging though the cap did provide a moment! The fourth drive packaging was cut on the bottom end and this seemed to allow easier extraction of the drive and the cap. Also, then) Insertion and removal from a powered USB hub; and, the same for other USB ports was reasonably effortless due to the lanyard connector that offered a place to get a grip.o) The flash drive device is not realy designed, in my opinion, for a lot of insertions and removals from a USB port. I always connect these \"cheap\" devices to a powered-USB port so any damage done by the device's connector only affects the easily replaced hub and does not damage my computer.Close, click \"eject\" ... and ... REMEMBER, it is better to be safe than be the \"did it to yourself\" victim because the \"Safely Remove Hardware\" icon in your tray was not used! A few words of CAUTION, do make sure the intended drive letter for the Flash Drive is the one chosen to be removed!", "domain": "electronics", "id": "8d5d8096b65ce54a5febe1f38f3c4f00", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "deal", "nn_mod": "great", "q_reviews_id": "94b0647ecb503f1bc64385a390129076", "query_asp": "review", "query_mod": "helpful", "ques_subj_score": 0.30000001192092896, "question": "Was the review very helpful?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "47ccfd1b4d31d4434eeefc342923bf20", "title": "B005FYNSPK", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "I feel like I have to start this review with a quick note...I know that a lot of people disliked this book, but I think it's mainly because they're upset at the ending. That's fine that you didn't like the ending because it's now how you thought, but please don't bash Ms. Roth, who is an amazing author. She has complete creative license to do whatever she wants. She can kill off whomever she wants, and write the story how she sees fit. And if this ending was how she imagined this series ending, then it's good enough for me. Was I upset at the ending, yes. Any rational person would be. I cried and cried, and then cried some more. I literally couldn't believe what just happened. But I also expected it in some ways (which I'll get to later in this review). So overall, I don't care if you complain about the ending, but just stop bashing Ms. Roth because there's a HUGE difference, at least to me, between bashing a book and bashing an author.Anyway, I personally thought this book was fantastic. There were a couple of things that I really didn't like, which is why if I could, I would give this 4.5 stars. However, overall, I greatly enjoyed it, and am very sad that this series is over. Let's start with the dual POV first. I loved being able to read from Tobias's perspective (but seriously, who wouldn't). I honestly wanted to read more from his POV then Tris's. Ms. Roth did a very good job at showing us the real Tobias, who is completely separate from Four. He's not as strong as he would have the world believe. Tobias is suffering and unsure. This glimpse into his true character made the book so much more enjoyable for me, and his character much more realistic. War changes people, and I for one am grateful for the inside look. Tris is struggling just as much in some ways. However, she is stronger, and ready to take on whatever may come her way. She thinks things through, but at times acts rashly. Her character was also very realistic to me, and while I didn't like her POV as much as the previous two novels (which I think was largely because of Tobias's being in this story as well), it was still a great look into her mind.This leads me to one of the things that I didn't like. I thought the dual POV was very poorly done. At first, I could easily tell the difference between Tris and Tobias's POV's. However, as the story progressed, it got harder and harder to tell who was actually talking. I found myself going back to the beginning to double check who was supposed to be talking because the voices sounded similar. Usually, you could tell who was who just by the setting that character was in, but when Tris and Tobias are in the same setting, it just got downright confusing. Dual POV is hard to pull off, but I was expecting a bit more from Ms. Roth on this front because I do think she is a great author that has an amazing talent.Next up is the setting and plot. I will agree that this was one of the weaker aspects of this book, however it wasn't that weak. Granted, I didn't enjoy this book as much as the other two, but this is also a completely different book revolving around completely different terms. Chicago is changing after Jeanine's death and Evelyn's rise to power, and this isn't necessarily a good thing. This is a very fast-paced book, but there were times where it was lagging. These parts easily could have been cut out, and the story wouldn't have suffered in the slightest. At the same time, I flew through this book. I wanted to keep reading to find out what was going to happen next. The circumstances are different in this book, and I think Ms. Roth did an excellent job at pulling everything together. All our questions are answered except one (at least in my mind). We find why this all happened (and why there were factions), we find out about Edith Prior and Tris's mom, we find out what it actually means to be Divergent. Basically, we find out the truth. I know that some people really disliked this portion of the book, but honestly, I feel that what Ms. Roth did made a lot of sense. I think another reason I liked where Ms. Roth took this book is because it speaks to the science person in me. Being a Biology major in college, this whole thing just clicked with me in a way. I don't feel that in anyway was this a cop-out. While it could have been a little bit better researched in some aspects, it still was a interesting and creative direction to take the story.Now onto the ending. First let me talk about this \"sex\" scene. I interpreted it as they did have sex. I'm not putting this under spoiler because you can go into any review already and find this out. However, it was confusing as heck by what she meant. I guess it's really up to the reader to interpret what they want, but this part of the book could have been done a whole lot better. This also goes for the romance in the book. I know that Ms. Roth put it in to appease readers (especially because of what happens at the end), but I thought a lot of times the romance was out of place, and just didn't fit very well. In my opinion, there was actually too much. The climax of this book blows you away. There's no way to lessen the blow or anything. You will cry and sob and think it's unfair. Should you not read this book solely because of this reason, no. You need to read the book. But just know that the ending will literally shred your heart to little itty bitty pieces, and you'll need at least a 2-3 day recovery period. This being said, I actually completely expected something like this to happen. Never once in this series has it been sunshine and rainbows, and to expect the ending of this book to change anything is silly. This book is about a war, and in war there are many many casualties. Sometimes people who you don't want to die, end up dying, while the people that you can't stand live long and happy lives. But again, this is exactly what happens in war.Ultimately, I thought this book was great, and even though it wasn't as good as the previous two, I still thought it was an amazing end to this series. The title could have been better (I mean I even was coming up with other titles for this book while reading), but don't let other reviews hinder you from enjoying this novel. My best advice is go into this book with an open mind. Don't expect everything to work out perfectly and remember the world that this series takes place in. Our world isn't perfect, so you can' expect the ending to work out perfectly. I can't wait to see what else Ms. Roth writes because I know that she is a great author that has a tremendous talent.", "domain": "books", "id": "a7a0e794551b29d40a0c76f2885bf45e", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "circumstance", "nn_mod": "different", "q_reviews_id": "75f0a84925d537dde29d44640d51a655", "query_asp": "life", "query_mod": "messy", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "What about the life?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "fafe139f7493684b07bcd68fb1b30e0c", "title": "0007444117", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [138, 138, 138], "text": ["The characters were interesting", "The characters were interesting and the history was sad", "The characters were interesting"]}, "context": "A good story is not easy to find.

Top of the list? Edulis, a local restaurant, thus relieving me of any need to continue my search. (They also made MacLean's Top 50 Best Restaurants in Canada.) A couple emails later, and our table was booked. (They say an online reservation system is coming soon.) Cozy and charming, this intimate restaurant is tucked away on a rather nondescript stretch of Niagara St. just south of King. The juxtaposition of the best restaurant in Canada facing onto a large co-op housing complex is worthy of note, and could serve as an archetype for boosters of mixed-income urban planning near and afar. Anyway, I digress.Debating between the smaller ($50) or larger ($70) tasting menus, our waitress indicated that the former would be sufficient to fill our bellies. We opted for the latter, and were prepared to have to undo a few buttons. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. Look, I get that higher-end restaurants skew towards smaller portions; I have no problem with that, and come to expect it. But if I'm ordering a seven-course tasting menu, I expect to be reasonably satiated by the end of the journey. Am I completely off base here? Alas, if it weren't for the constant re-filling of our bread basket (great home-made bread, btw), we all would have left hungry - and it's not like we have huge appetites to begin with. The blame I think is two-fold: First, many of the dishes were protein-heavy, with very little in the way of carbs. This is regrettable, as the one significant starch I do recall (a side of potatoes in a Djion vinaigrette) was phenomenal. Second, there was way too much downtime between some of the courses. Easily 20-25 minutes passed between some of the courses. Had the intervals been a bit shorter, I think we would have been okay.Not to say that service wasn't exemplary. As soon as we entered service was fantastic. Water was constantly topped off, fresh cutlery was brought out every meal, and the table was kept spotless. Presumably the bottleneck was in the kitchen. That being said, the actual food when it came was superb. Of the seven dishes, four consisted of seafood (herring, mussles, tuna, some white fish), two of meat (veal and sweetbreads, duck two ways), and dessert (ice cream and cookie, shared baba au rhum cake). I'd try to describe them in more detail, but would be doing them an injustice. The food was outstanding - I just wish there were more of it.Next time I think a better strategy would be to order a few dishes \u00e0 la carte, and share those. I saw some tables adopting this strategy and the serving sizes seemed substantial. It would also eliminate some of the waiting between courses.8/30", "domain": "restaurants", "id": "0bfb6647f34219c9b898f220e73f235c", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "restaurant", "nn_mod": "best", "q_reviews_id": "822937a77f5f19003419fd3cdc4b3811", "query_asp": "lamb", "query_mod": "tender", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "What was the quality of the lamb?", "question_subj_level": 2, "review_id": "9-UUZtC0NazDYhXYH_Q5EQ", "title": "37kk0IW6jL7ZlxZF6k2QBg", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "After reading reviews from about every site there is (including Amazon & CNET), I decided to go with this router to replace my faulty one.

I also liked for once the girl wasn't a virgin, that is just done so much in books now that sometimes it can get a little old.

Maybe I can find me a hot, adorable guy to wake up married to. That would just be great. And awww David was just so tasty and lovable I loved him right from the start, you knew he was going to be great the moment you realized how hurt he was in the beginning of the story. I just wanted to hug him and tell him it would all be ok. Plus I mean come on he has tattoos and long hair, yeah a lot of book boyfriends have tattoos but not many have long hair. Drool.Their love story was full of ups, downs, sideways, long ways and any ways you can possibly think of. It was perfect and so real that I felt like maybe I could live it. I was so rooting for them that I got pissed when that stuff with the witch Martha happened (boooo you whore) that I just wanted to put the book down and punch a pillow or maybe punch a man, yeah that would of been better lol.

She was cute, likeable and funny- and it all makes sense because she doesn't know very much about the world outside of the IPCA. I know a lot of people thought that Evie's pink taser named Tasey was ridiculous- but even that gave her an individual flare and funky style. I really liked how Evie was different from the new trend in YA female protagonists- it was extremely refreshing.Secondary characters: 4/5I really liked Lend and I especially loved the way White developed their relationship as more of a friendship at first. The only secondary character I wanted more from was Reth- I wish I knew more about his motivations and why he was so obsessed with Evie. I think it was very cool how White exploited and played upon some of the stereotypes already in play in paranormal YA fiction, as well as jumping outside the box and creating fun and memorable new characters.Writing style: 4/5I loved the personality in the character's conversations, and most of the pace was exceptional. It moved easily and quickly without skipping things or making me confused. There were a couple scenes in the middle where things started to drag, but they were few and far between. White had a fast-paced and witty writing style that I enjoyed.Plot: 3.5/5I thought the initial concept was adorable and fairly original. I love the first couple chapters as they just lay out the feel of the novel and introduce the premise so smoothly! The conflict kept my attention, but I wouldn't say it was particularly innovative or fascinating. I did enjoy some of the twists, as they kept me guessing.Ending: 3.5/5Slightly anticlimactic, but still reasonable. I like how it had a complete conflict that resolved itself, but still left many questions to be asked.Best scene: Meeting Lend in the IPCA headquartersPositives: Strong characters, fast-moving and enjoyable writing style, unique premiseNegatives: Just okay conflict, a couple slower partsFirst Line: \"Wait-did you-You just yawned!\" The vampire's arms, raised over his head in the classic Dracula pose, dropped to his sides.Cover: Absolutely gorgeous!

It is not terrible at all, but a couple items were real dealbreakers for me:1) Low volume level on DVD and Blu-Ray playbackThis must be something specific to LG. I have an LG DVR (LRM-519) that is a few years old and it has the exact same problem. When I play Blu-Ray discs or regular DVDs, I have to turn the volume on my TV or Sony AV Receiver way, way up just to hear the movie at a normal level. I was watching Baby Mama and had to crank my Receiver up to the max volume just to hear it. It is connected with an optical cable, but I have the same issue with the volume through the TV which is connected using HDMI. I previously had my Xbox 360 connected to my AV Receiver and DVDs sounded amazing. I didn't have to turn up the receiver past 45 to get it really booming. With the LG BD 370, I had to crank it at 70 (max).2) The player uses the same remote IR commands as my LG DVRVery few other people will probably run into this problem, but the BD 370 happens to use the same remote control commands as my existing LG DVR. So, for example, when I turn on the BD 370, the DVR also turns on. When I press the Open/Close button on the remote, the DVD tray on both my DVR and Blu-Ray player open. When I press Menu on the remote, it brings up the menu on my DVR and my blu-ray player. This was just an annoyance at first until I realized that watching netflix or a bluray disc on the BD 370 could actually cause me to stop something from recording on my DVR due to the random command being sent to the DVR as I control the blu-ray player.3) Netflix only shows Instant QueueI admit, this is a very minor gripe, but I really got spoiled by the Netflix experience on my Xbox 360. On the xbox 360, the netflix menu shows not only the movies you have added to your instant queue, but also lets you browse a selection of shows/movies in other categories. I have found that I use that feature a lot. So I was pretty disappointed to see that it isn't replicated on the BD 370. However, the quality of the streaming on the BD 370 was every bit as good as on the Xbox 360. Also, I had zero problems connecting to netflix when I hooked up the player. I just connected the player to my router with an ethernet cable and it had no problem getting on netflix.Pro - The ability to watch Youtube on the BD 370 was cool, especially because it allowed me to log into my Youtube account and access my favorites. However, that was not enough to make me want to keep the player.All in all, if you don't mind the low volume level and you don't have any other LG DVD players or DVRs connected to the same TV as the BD 370, it is a pretty decent unit.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "34cc58aead0df79f6fdd3c4a737af926", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "issue", "nn_mod": "same", "q_reviews_id": "683a4ed1cb0a6da55d47cd38135bd356", "query_asp": "problem", "query_mod": "big", "ques_subj_score": 0.10000000149011612, "question": "Do you have a big problem?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "331e6974b022075b236705f1c85cc508", "title": "B001UQ6F4S", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "i have had a Zumo 550 for the motorcycle.

Right away, I noticed the range and speed were lower than what I was used to with the WRT45G. My wireless laptop would get 4-5 bars connection strength with the WRT45G, with the E1200 I get 3-4 at most. My download speed fell 6 Mbps (!) according to the speedtest website, though my upload speed was unaffected - I don't download a terrible large amount of stuff or run multiple internet reliant applications at once so this does not have too much impact on me personally at the moment, but it might concern me over time if I increase my internet usage and the speed loss becomes an issue. I know the loss in speed is due to the new router since when I reconnected my old router the speed went back up. There might be settings to \"tweak\" that would improve the speed, but I am admittedly not particularly tech-savvy, and as far as connecting routers go, I follow the basic instructions and leave it at that since it seems to have worked for me that way all these years. The E1200 also runs warmer than my WRT45G. The temperature is not enough to concern me about being \"too\" warm, but it is noticeable, vs what I would call the \"not worth noticing\" temperature the WRT45G used to run at. The E1200 is actually the piece running warmest out of all my Internet devices (Cisco CM100 modem, OBi110) I leave on 24/7.The only real advantage the E1200 has for me over the WRT45G is the appearance. It is nearly 1/2 as thick and much more appealing to look at without the antennae and sleek black exterior. The E1200 router has worked steadily without issues, but since I don't need to worry about appearance so much since I stick all my devices where they can't be seen, I would rather stick to the old WRT45G.One word of advice for when you're setting up the router for the very first time - make sure not to plug the router in and/or connect any cables until you get to the screen (after inserting setup CD and launching) where it tells you to do so..

The writing is powerful and captivating, it was hard to put down.\"264 days of isolation. Juliette has been locked up in a cell consisting of 4 walls and 1 window. She hadn't seen or touched a single human being for 3 years until Adam Kent was sent to be her cellmate. That's where the story began and I was hooked immediately, excited to know who the boy was, and his connection to Juliette. I was excited to know why The Reestablishment put Juliette in the institution and why they suddenly put a boy in her room. I loved how the story was written in such a way that it became even more effective to see what's in Juliette's head and the things she had been thinking and feeling and I hope I could see Adam in the same way.\"Of course I remember you.\" My voice strangled whisper. I squeeze my eyes shut. I remember you every day forever in every broken moment of my life. \"You were the only one who ever looked at me like a human being.\" - JulietteYou're going to love Adam Kent. It is always one of the things I look for in a story. A guy whom I can see myself rooting for. He's one of those sweet, sexy and dependable guy that you will put on your list of swoon-worthy book boyfriends that will make you fall in love over again. With a strong hero comes a strong heroine and a book is dull without them. Juliette is definitely one tough girl and I liked her because she has a good heart. I don't think I can describe Juliette in a more effective way than this, so I chose Adam's exact words as she said this words to her.\"A million times... I saw you do things like that a million times. But you never said a word unless it was forced out of you... You never asked for anything from anyone... But no one ever gave you a chance.\" -AdamI always loved a character with goodness in their heart because they inspire me... to do good, to think right. Juliette is one of those heroines that I tend to love because of that. Not just a kick-ass, but also kind-hearted.What I liked most about this book is the love story and that the words were written beautifully and effectively. It was surprisingly good and refreshing since I didn't expected it to be some kind of superhero thing. I realized that Juliette actually reminds me of Rogue. I wonder if Tehereh Mafi is a fan of X-Men and if she, too (like me) is fascinated by Rogue. It was quite interesting and I am excited to see how the things will turn out in the next books.I loved everything about this book except for the world-building which I think is lacking. I hope that the author gave us a clear picture of the \"The Reestablishment\", the leaders, and the society. Dystopian novels is one of my favorite genre, and it's important (I think) that we are given a clear image of the dystopian world and what it takes to live in that horrific period. Other than that, this book is great in many ways.An engaging book like this with strong characters and amazing story line will win the hearts of readers who enjoy paranormal-dystopian novels with deliciously crafted romance.

In the case of Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn's third crime thriller, the trouble isn't so much that I have to give away specific plot details as that I have to discuss the narrative structure in a way that might make alert readers able to predict some of those details when they otherwise wouldn't have. Those who want to experience the novel without such inadvertent guidance should avoid reading beyond the first paragraph of this review, and content themselves with this capsule statement: Gone Girl is a compelling page-turner, but turns away from the insight into real human behavior that might have made it a literary as well as a plot-driven triumph.That ultimate lack of insight is all the more disappointing because the book initially suggests a nuanced and thoroughly contemporary character study. The protagonists, Nick Dunne and his wife Amy, were writers in New York City until the economic downturn left them both jobless. The nearly-simultaneous news that Nick's mother was terminally ill made a move back to his Missouri hometown seem like a good idea. But within two years their already-fragile relationship is so strained that when Amy disappears on the morning of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick soon becomes the prime suspect. His first-person narration of events after the disappearance alternates with Amy's diary entries about their life together, and between the two accounts there are enough questions raised to make a reader wonder whether Nick, an admitted liar, is really capable of murder.This first section of the novel, which takes up about half of its 400 pages, is a brilliant blend of plot development and character work. Both Nick and Amy are complicated, frustrating, ultimately sympathetic human beings, and the emotional dynamics of their marriage, which threaten to undermine their obvious mutual love, reflect modern problems of gender, gender roles, and sexism. Nick is a bit of a cad, spoiled, selfish, sometimes petulant, often blind to his wife's needs, while Amy is so concerned with being a generous, understanding, non-traditional wife that she can't bring herself to admit the existence of those needs. All this plays out against the backdrop of the uncertain modern economy, in which not just the Dunnes but their neighborhood of abandoned McMansions, their town of unemployed, rootless indigents, seem permanently perched on the brink of disaster. If the rest of the book had maintained this emphasis on character and setting, Gone Girl would have been one of my favorite novels of the year.Instead, the halfway point brings a plot twist that throws everything you think you know into doubt. As a story development this is mostly well achieved, though one of the devices used verges on a narrative cheat and I'm not sure of the plausibility of certain points. The problem is that the revelation completely undermines the established characterization, and what replaces it isn't nearly as interesting as the Nick and Amy you thought you were reading about. Personalities like the one that dominates the second half of Gone Girl do exist, but they're rare in real life and overexposed in crime fiction, where they allow for twisty plotting and chilling (but ultimately less than profound) character study. As a story this one is indeed satisfying-- I read the last 200 pages in a single sitting-- but it doesn't really have anything to say about the world we live in. Near the end there's something approaching a theme about the nature of love, but the character and plot points involved are so exaggerated that its deeper relevance is minimal.Here as in her first two books, Gillian Flynn is a sharp, distinctive, often funny writer whose prose is compulsively readable without sacrificing character voice. She knows how to contrive and select details and incidents that make her protagonists distinctive as individuals yet recognizable as people dealing with universal human dilemmas. And she can shape a plot like nobody's business. Unfortunately, in the case of Gone Girl the latter skill works to the detriment of the former ones, with story swallowing theme and character. The book does too much too well not to earn a recommendation, but it's also a deeply frustrating experience.", "domain": "books", "id": "3d1b7256f9b7817d0471e036107a8d33", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "prose", "nn_mod": "readable", "q_reviews_id": "ae109166a49a6300f4c9af298fa368e3", "query_asp": "star", "query_mod": "generous", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the star?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "09a6069159a2db705a4246154599267b", "title": "030758836X", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [268], "text": ["The display is really great"]}, "context": "This is a review for Nexus 7 2013, 32 GB Wifi only model.

I would definitely place it on my top 5 list of all times and I have read hundreds and hundreds of books.Katniss is such an engaging character. The reader is drawn to her instantly, as we are plunged into a futuristic world of oppression, poverty and despair. Katniss has taken on the responsibility of caring for her family after her father died in a mining explosion and her mother shut down. Katniss is daring and ventures out into forbidden areas to hunt and gather food to sell to the people in her \"district\". Her only goal in life seems to be keeping her little sister safe.The government has set up a lottery in each of the twelve \"districts\" in this futuristic country. One boy and one girl are chosen to go fight to the death with the \"tributes\" from the other eleven districts. When Prim, Katniss's little sister, is chosen for the Hunger Games as they are called Katniss steps forward and volunteers to go in her place.Katniss goes to the capitol with the other tribute from her district, a boy named Peeta, and there they must put on a good show before the game begins. If they set up the right image they could get sponsors during the game, which means they will receive gifts and help once they enter the arena. Sponsors are the difference between life and death for many tributes so it is important to give the people what they want.The game itself is brutal. It reminded me a tiny bit of the show survivor, only in this game you have to kill off all the other players. Katniss has a slight advantage from her hunting and gathering experience, but she must also use her wits and bravery to keep herself alive. Foreign alliances with other players can be helpful, but true trust and friendship is practically impossible since there can only be one winner.The book drives its characters to the very edge of their abilities. We see how people react in the most primal and brutal situations: forced to kill or be killed. I loved seeing the tributes come up with different strategies for survival, and how the game makers who control everything in the arena throw the tributes at each other through force and bribery.I read this book yesterday, and had dreams and nightmares about it all night.

But, when get past the hype and internet complaints, you have yourself a pretty decent movie. Sure it had some bad parts. Okay, it had some REALLY bad parts. The story wasn't all that fascinating, tha characterization is weak, Darth Vader's an exuberant little kid, And Jar Jar Binks is the most annoying character ever. But the movie is still worthy of the Star Wars title. I can't tell you how many times I was in gasping in awe of the sheer visuals in the film. To me, the good redeems the movie for it's worser parts. As for the legions of fans who hated this movie, I think they were expecting it to be like the first time theysaw Star Wars.

We were both tourists in Sweden and after some small talk she mentioned that she had been living in Dresden during the firebombing of WWII. I tried to press her for details, but it was clear that the mere mention of that event was opening up horrible memories for her and she couldn't bear to talk about it anymore. This was in 1995 -- 50 years after the event.Mockingjay is a remarkable novel, because it brings the reader deep inside the psyche of a person like that woman on the bench. Through Katniss, we are able to see a person transform from a little girl learning about the forest from her father into a woman whose nightmares are almost unbearable, and which will never go away. Most admirable is that this important lesson about the long term cost of warfare, is being directed at a Young Adult readership.The transformation of Katniss felt real, and it felt natural, and it felt like something that was in the plans from the very first pages of this book. I remember that when I first met Haymitch, I found his negative attitude irritating. By the end of this book, I was left feeling like I could totally understand where he was coming from. In fact, by understanding Katniss, I even found myself finally having a better understanding of what might have driven Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain to suicide in 1994.I am very grateful to Suzanne Collins that she did not make this a story of a little girl transforming into a superhero. War heros are real, but even in the most justified war situation, war heroes leave the battlefield scarred for life. Collins knew this, because her own father was a Vietnam vet who had a lifetime of nightmares to contend with. The best way of honoring these people, like her father, is to depict this depressing reality of the unavoidable cost of war.Reading Katniss's story was so compelling that I found myself able to overlook many of the unsatisfying aspects of this book. My chief problem with these books is that as Katniss ventured further and further from her beautifully depicted home in District 12, the environment she found herself in felt less and less fully realized and more and more contrived. These gripes began in earnest with the second book, and contined with this third book. The biggest offender here is The Capitol, which is described in much more detail than before. I am sure the author has good reasons for why the city planners of The Capitol needed to fill it with booby traps. For me, the place just felt like a silly videogame, which detracted a bit from the very serious drama taking place on the streets of that city. Still, these are minor issues that I found myself able to overlook. It is only because the psychological storylines are so strong that I wish this book's description of environment was as detailed and satisfying as it was in Tolkein's Lord of the Rings, but I realize that this is an unrealistic expectation.I am surprised by the many negative reviews written about this book. So many detractors of this book seem to be let down by the negative tone of this book. It is interesting how these negative reviews contrast so sharply with the near universal praise the book has received from adult book critics. I do think that older readers probably have more personal life experiences to help them appreciate the negative tone of this book. Us older people understand that there are some sad memories that never go away, and that life can be worth living anyways. So, to those young readers depressed by this book, I only implore you not to despair over the fact that Katniss's life didn't turn out as nice as you hoped, but instead take heart in the fact that so many adults have embraced these books. I would venture to say that almost all of us adults who are parents have some dark corners buried in our psyche that can keep us awake at night, but like Katniss we have all found our own ways to cope with the inevitable disappointments that life has thrown us, and for the most part we all eventually find a way to enjoy life despite all the lousy stuff that we have to step through along the way.", "domain": "books", "id": "e615e45d62b4d1b49e99cf4bc7b4f6f5", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "reason", "nn_mod": "good", "q_reviews_id": "7bb7138e1d8116ea0756cbce2f5049a4", "query_asp": "opinion", "query_mod": "own", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the opinion?", "question_subj_level": 2, "review_id": "e02c3d1f9814b292d2271ba0f3b5133a", "title": "0439023513", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [48], "text": ["The front desk was friendly and prompt"]}, "context": "We stayed there this past weekend and LOVED it!

Pros: Although the neighborhood is such that I would not have ventured out alone at night, the location is convenient to shopping and the financial district/government center which was what I needed. During the day I enjoyed walking around to see the sites, shop and experience some of the local eateries and pubs. I loved the Adagio's Tapas restaurant and bar in the evenings. Sat at the bar. Great food, wonderful service, attractive upscale clientele and space. Check in was rather perfunctory. I felt the front desk attendant was a little surly and snobby. I had booked a superior smoking room. Upon arrival, the desk clerk advised that I was booked in non-smoking. After I corrected him, I was given a key to what I have to assume was the worst room in the hotel. I had a single bed. Not a double, queen or king. A single. It was like summer camp. The mattress was old and lumpy. The room was by the elevator and noisy day and night. Housekeeping didn't show up until 3:30 or 4 on both days of my stay. She didn't empty the garbage even. There was no bell service either coming or going. My view was of fire escapes of some downtrodden multifamily dwelling. The room downgrade was not explained to me, nor was any adjustment to my room rate offered. Breakfast in the restaurant was underwhelming and overpriced. I have a pet peeve about arriving in a nearly empty restaurant alone and being seated in the worst possible spot. I had my newspaper and was dressed in business casual attire. For some unknown reason, I was seated in the darkest corner near the kitchen. This type of thing often happens in hotel restaurants. Presumably the idea is to fill up the bad seats in case some VIP comes along. I cannot stress what a bad impression this sort of treatment leaves in a guest's mind. From this point forward, I look for the negative, not the positive because I don't want to like the place. Advice to Restaurant management. Don't do this if you don't want to get slammed in reviews by travelers like me.I have read numerous positive reviews of this hotel on both this and other websites.

What a wonderful place! We booked a queen room, but got a small suite at the front of the hotel - the bed was a little smaller, but it had a separate sitting room with a sofa, chair and desk and a second plasma flat screen tv. But the great thing about this inn is the extras, which are offered free of charge. First, breakfast is served each morning until 10 or so on each floor on the third and fifth floors parlours. The quality is good, with fresh high quality pastries and coffee as well as cereal, boiled eggs, bagels, cheese, fruit, tea, etc. It is served on china and cloth napkins with nice breakfast trays to take back to your room and small tables to eat in the parlour. Also, there are fresh apples and cookies in each parlour all day long. At 5 or so, they set out multiple bottles of wine with really good cheese and fruit and stemware and napkins again and welcome you to a drink before you go out to dinner. There are also other cold drinks set out. All free of charge. There is wireless internet available free of charge, as well as a small business center. At night, the maid leaves bottled water and chocolate. At the end of the weekend, we had not a single incidental charge. The staff is young and enthusiastic and they are genuinely helpful. Be warned - this is an inn more than a hotel - it is narrow and the hallways are narrow as well. The elevator is small and there is no grand lobby, just a number of small parlours. But the rooms are tastefully done with good linens and the furniture and tvs are of good quality. There is no noise from room to room, and our room was right outside the parlour where folks on our floor had breakfast. There is some noise from the street - it is 500 feet off Powell and those streetcars do make noise, so if you really like it quiet, get a room in back. The rooms in front offer a nice view to compensate for the noise.

There are several fixes, but the most common and reliable way is to go to your Computer Management (Windows) and click the unrecognized drive \"online\". You can then assign it a different Drive Letter which will then allow you to see it every time you plug it in. Without going into too much details, basically WD assigned the same signature to the drives that is why it is showing up as one drive at a time. As a result, I moved the rating up to 5 stars. Enjoy!///Original: 12Oct2012///I love how small it still is (compared to a regular 1TB). When I travel I try to maximize my contents without compromising the weight and space taken. I often have to travel in just a backpack for several days so having the drive is perfect for having my digital movies and tv because it does not require an adapter for power (just USB) and it does not take up so much room. Because of the amount of files I own, I ended up buying 3 of these (only needed 2, but didn't realize I previously bought one already).I do however have some issues with it. Unfortunately, laptops cannot recognize two of the same type of drive. So if you were to transfer files from one drive to the next, you much use a median to temporarily store your data first (ie. laptop itself or a non-WD 2TB Passport Drive).Other than that, I am quite satisfied. Data transfer with USB 3.0 is noticeably superior to USB 2.0. In comparison to cheaper drives with USB 3.0 (not to cause blame on other drives), this performed data transfer faster and more consistently. I have used mine for some time now and through my travels overseas and it is still going strong even with the climate changes (extreme hot in the desert and snowing winter).Bottom line, a must have item for large media files during any time of travels due to its capacity, portability, and size.

Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.Before we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read Verst. And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.Their dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.Now, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and Saut\u00e9ed Jalape\u00f1os. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.Another one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries. But the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.Until next time Foodies!Buen Provecho,Viviana.", "domain": "restaurants", "id": "75ddedac2c3a17c412535867329ec0a8", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "fry", "nn_mod": "soft", "q_reviews_id": "d30d3bcd632e5f24d81ca104cd45039d", "query_asp": "fry", "query_mod": "a", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is fry?", "question_subj_level": 4, "review_id": "mfA4o9z9i4Zqj_7xIvZedw", "title": "h_4dPV9M9aYaBliH1Eoeeg", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [191], "text": ["Service was outstanding"]}, "context": "Hotel is close to China town and Union Square, a little further walk to Fisherman's wharf.

Some of the minor characters (Wendy's brother Matt for example, and Tove have some unexpected depth, and I loved seeing glimpses of them)Negatives: (May be some minor spoilers in here)1. When Wendy's power (the main one) is introduced, I couldn't wait to see what she would do with it. She was already able to use persuasion in her life before joining her family, so why, oh why wouldn't she use it when being attached at the Christening Ball thing? Or when Finn was being attacked and in danger? Or any other time she was in real trouble? This thought echoed through my head at various times through the book, and interefered with my ability to suspend belief the way we all do when reading paranormals.2. Elora, in particular, didn't seem to have much basis to her character. I got that she was cold towards people, but unless we truly understand mitive, and give her a human side/intuition/motive, I found her character a little hard to believe.3. Finn I wanted to love. AS the main love interest in the book, I wanted to fall in love with him along with Wendy. But his character seemed weak to me, and the whole concept of toeing the line because it was his job, didn't seem to me to be reason enough to keep them apart.But I'm interested enough to read the rest of the series.

Clary is easy to connect with and she is smart. Sometimes she can't see what is right in front of her but she keeps it together and is determined to find her mom.Simon - Simon is Clary's best friend and I love his humor and optimism. He is an awesome character. He is so witty and kept me laughing throughout the book. I really enjoy the comfortableness that is there in his friendship with Clary.Jace - I love his snarky and badass wit. He is smart, brave and just a great character. On the surface he is serious, honest and smart - underneath Clary brings out a more sensitive, caring side. Just like Alec says - Jace thinks he needs to save the world.Isabelle - I love Isabelle's way. She isn't out rightly a nice person but she isn't a mean person either - just really honest and a bit arrogant. My favourite scene with her is right at the end with Clary - where have a beautiful bonding moment.Alec - Initially Alec comes across really rude and offish, especially towards Clary. I could see why Alec seemed put out by Clary. It's as if Jace doesn't need him anymore and is utterly absorbed by Clary. I could see his troubles and I think great things will still come for Alec.Magnus Bane - I loved Magnus in The Infernal Devices. I don't feel he played a huge part in this story but I do think (and hope) to see more of him in the rest of the series.Hodge - Hodge is such a misunderstood character, I felt so sorry for him. I don't think he really knows where his loyalties and heart lie. He may have started off on one side, but near the end he makes some decisions to help people, regardless of what is in store for him.I cannot say I have one favourite character - I love them all!Plot, Pace, Writing style: 5/5The plot was captivating and gripping.

Kept looking at the Microsoft Surface RT (didn't want to pay the price of the pro) and also looking here at ASUS and Lenovo. When I saw the Venue come out I wanted to touch one so went to the Microsoft Store a few blocks from my office. I spent about an hour going back and forth between the Suface 2 and the Venue. The main reason was size and comparison between RT and Full Windows 8.1. I wanted something that splits between a PC, Tablet, and eReader (huge Kindle fan). After thinking about what my life would be like sitting on an Airplane and what would be more comfortable to work with I picked the Venue 8 Pro. I have had this for about 4 days now (bought at Microsoft Store, price was the same as prime and I was in an instant satisfaction mode).What I like:1. Size, this is large enough that the office tools, apps, and web browsing are functional2. It keeps my Kindle on my night stand when I travel. I was using my Windows Phone and it worked find but it was a bit small and this is much better and holds like my Kindle3. It is full blown Windows, not RT so I can load my other apps on it4. The disk space is good, with 64G it leaves over 30G to use, I added a 32G MicroSD card to it and can't think of how I will run out of space.5. Full Windows from the start screen is familiar, don't need to learn anything new. Not a huge fan of Windows 8 but on a tablet it works great.What I don't like:Configuring Windows 8.1 on a small device is a bit tedious, so need to be patient on the setups and get a stylus (I had one).The few comments on the start button being on the side really isn't an issue, a left swipe from the right side of the screen gets you to start very quickly. So far battery is great, I did remove the dimming and put my own setting on. I got alittle over 9 hours on the battery that way and other than international flights don't know when I wouldn't be in a position to charge it throughout the day.The screen is good, I added a bluetooth keyboard / case to this and still getting used to the keyboard. The split keyboard on screen actually works well in the hand and I may toss the bluetooth keyboard. I don't plan on writing documents on this and mostly for email, reading, and browsing.Already put Pandora on it, sounds OK with the speaker. Have Sonos at home and have that installed as well as few other apps I like. Really don't need thousands of apps and there are enough to make this fully functional for my use.The last point is I didn't buy an Apple because they just charge too much for the brand. I actually had a significant amount of interest from the iPAD users who started to go look at reviews on this after they saw it. $349 for a Full Windows 8 tablet with 64G, 8&#34; screen (Kindle form factor) is hard to ignore.Go ahead and buy it, you will like it for utility.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "32dfbe2068b40c62ff3c183058bc3a0a", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "screen", "nn_mod": "good", "q_reviews_id": "0b3af12df1707bc8a2dd704189ac2371", "query_asp": "screen", "query_mod": "bad", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How do you like the screen?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "f334c26b183b29d63901f99527fd5cbc", "title": "B00FEE7B1I", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "This place is AH-mazing, probably not for the older crowd becos it's very loud n they scream at u when u coming in n out..but,the food can be described as authentic japanese or izakaya street food..(so far I found)small portion so u can try every ill bit of everything and very tasty!!And price, affordable!Great place to hang out,chit-chat, amazing staff!everybody smiles!!U will never see any grumpy waitress like some restaurants,VERY CLEAN!Ull find FLOSS!!MOUTHWASH!TAMPON!!COMPLIMENTARY!!!That's how organized n thoughtful they r to the customer!!", "domain": "restaurants", "id": "908386cd4199d55f73436ece8f9463be", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "portion", "nn_mod": "tasty", "q_reviews_id": "abdbf2cfda3665f9af594fe5415c9bfa", "query_asp": "dish", "query_mod": "salty", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "Is a salty dish?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "QKmm-8YMiQA4mODyQl1xgg", "title": "RtUvSWO_UZ8V3Wpj0n077w", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [0, 84], "text": ["I like the patio here", "mostly come for drinks on the patio"]}, "context": "I like the patio here, and the pizza is pretty good.

In other words, special- effects-wise, it isn't just about visuals but the audio as well.Although the story of the father (Tom Cruise) and his two estranged (is anyone pictured married in films nowadays?) kids is so-so at best - and, as menntioned, really annoying at times - the film is all about the action.

Sadly, Paramount is squeezing us Trekkies/Trekkers/Addicts like members of the mob would squeeze an inner-city grocery-store, with their outrageous prices. $85.00 AFTER a 35% discount? Ironic, being that in the show they're selling, money is no longer used. Another thing that's bugged me in ALL the Trek DVD sets is the horrendous chapter break that happens after opening credits. It jumps you about five minutes into the actual episode. There is no way to skip the credit sequence, without missing a good chunk of the show. Sure, it's fun the first 135 you narrate along with Captain Kirk talking about the Final Frontier, but it gets old by the 140th session, unless you really start adding variety by sucking in a balloon full of helium before speaking the words William ... Shatner ... reads ... with ... such ... high ... melodrama. The picture quality is decent. Probably not what you'd expect for the price. Paramount didn't send in a restoration team to make this look as pretty as something released today should. You know something wasn't done right with this set when these shows from the 60s look WORSE than Chaplin movies from the 20s do, in the Chaplin Collection (now THAT'S restoration). What makes this worth the purchase are the compelling stories, great chemistry between the cast, nifty mini-skirts, cheesy alien outfits and finally getting to own the original episodes on DVD. Is that worth $85.00, when you can still watch any of these shows for free on television? It's your call. At these prices, I've only purchased season 3, 4 and 5 of The Next Generation and this set of The Original Series. I've rented each season of Deep Space Nine (at a more reasonable price, I would have bought them) and stopped, pointed and laughed wildly at the first three seasons of Voyager, whenever I pass them in the store. You make the call and make sure you make the right one, because the execs at Paramount would just assume stomp a Tribble with bare feet than they would issue you a refund because you feel ripped-off, after opening the set and realizing you're basically getting a sort of washed-out collection of episodes in neat packaging and nothing more (the extras are weak).5 stars for the shows. 2 stars for the value. 3 stars overall.", "domain": "movies", "id": "1c0b640e18be5356c9390a8c47a50fa4", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "show", "nn_mod": "bad", "q_reviews_id": "ccf6fb60138cbd4fe857b3b0520fcda5", "query_asp": "episode", "query_mod": "first", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the quality of episode?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "5398058a56389bf1dbd38be2beb40a82", "title": "B0002I831S", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [15], "text": ["great wine list and helpful"]}, "context": "Lovely dinner, great wine list and helpful, informative and attentive waitstaff.

Well, him and his master Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are assigned to protect former queen turned senator Padme (Natalie Portman) after ten years apart from an assassin. This job eventually leads to Obi-Wan being separated from Anakin while he investigates the assassin who happens to be involved with a cloning conspiracy and this later leads him to a renegade Jedi master played by Christopher Lee. Guess what? Anakin still has the hots for Padme and whilst Obi-Wan is away Anakin would like nothing better than to strip her naked and get her in the sack. The future Darth Vader also has a nightmare about his mom's death back on Tatioone and he FINALLY goes to rescue her but by the time he gets there she's already dead so he goes and kills the cannibal Sand People who killed her.This is one of those films that leaves you wondering \"How did this EVER get green lit?\" The answer is that it got green lit because of George Lucas's success with the original trilogy and the fact that he backed the film up with his own money and what not. This leads to another question: \"How could anyone have thought that this was a good script?\" The answer is no one, but they signed on to it anyway because they all knew they'd get paychecks and they knew people would come out in droves to see it and make it a hit regardless of whether it's good or not. I remember watching \"Phantom Menace\" and coming away feeling like \"What happened? HOW could this have happened?\"How many things are wrong with this film? Well, I think we all agree that the title sucks so I won't dwell on that for too long. One of the big things working against this movie is the fact that the character relationships, which should be the meat of the film, are never fully defined and/or explored (a similar problem afflicted 2003's \"Daredevil\"). George Lucas keeps TELLING us a bunch of things in interviews, but he doesn't depict them particularly well. He TOLD us that Anakin and Obi-Wan were good friends and he TOLD us that Anakin and Padme fall in love, but the manner in which he plays it out is very forced, ersatz and unbelievable. At this point, Anakin's relationship with Obi-Wan is starting to deteriorate; this is a good thing, but it makes very little sense as depicted because the relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan, which should have been the main focus of \"Menace\", was never explored or established in PM, thanks to the continuity error of Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn character. Ultimately what we're left with is the impression that these two never liked each other much; the only hint of friendship we get is when Obi-Wan tries to comfort Anakin about his nightmares of his mother's death.Which leads to one of the biggest problems with the film - Anakin's mother. It was hard enough to believe that Anakin actually LEFT his mom in PM, but it's even harder to believe that ten years have passed and Anakin never bothered to go back and rescue her from Tatioone. Seeing as how the Jedi Knights are supposed to be great heroes and humanitarians, it's hard to believe that the Jedi - least of all Obi-Wan Kenobi - would not allow Anakin to go back for his mom, especially when you consider how much easier it would have made training him. Or the fact that Padme was rich from being an \"elected queen\" (I can't stand that crap) and could very easily have paid the money to free the Skywalker mother. And when he's too late to save her, Anakin goes on a killing spree against the Sand People; okay, they beat his mom to a pulp, I admit that will p*** a guy off, but the circumstances surrounding it simply make no sense, dramatically or logistically.Don't forget the poorly illustrated relationship between Anakin and the future Emperor either (Ian McDiarmid, now playing the young version of his villain from \"Return of the Jedi\").The much hyped love story is also unpleasant, despite a nicely done love theme by John Williams. The majority of it is Anakin leering at Padme like some kind of lusty, sex starved stalker who can't wait to tear all her clothes off and rape the hell out of her and she clearly doesn't like it. Then again, I guess it's hard NOT to leer at a girl like Natalie Portman when everything she wears is either strapless, backless, or gutless. For someone who's a proponent of anti-sleaze in films, Natalie goes out on quite a limb here, even donning black leather (it's like porn for Star Wars fans). The age difference is also an annoying little factor, thus spawning the question of what the older and considerably more mature Padme sees in the future Darth Vader. Bad boy nothing, he continually goes flying off the handle for no apparent reason, even by growing pains standards, and then he goes on the aforementioned killing spree and instead of horrifying her and revolting her it only seems to get her to fall in love with him. I'm all for tragic, doomed love affairs but the truth is that there's no real reason for these two to get together except that Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia need a mom. And what was up with the line about hating sand?Politics are not particularly well done either. Having Jar Jar Binks back and having him play a key role in the rise of the Empire - convincing the senate to okay the creation of the Clone Army thus starting the Clone Wars mentioned in the original film - is quite insulting.The acting is a mixed bag at best. Ewan McGregor manages to make the young Obi-Wan (who now looks like Jesus Christ) a somewhat poetic and likable figure, whilst Samuel L. Jackson is a capable Jedi and Christopher Lee does his usual larger than life villain. Natalie Portman, as cute as she may be, can't make heads nor tails of her Padme, always talking in a flat, high pitched voice that makes her sound too much like a girl and not enough like a woman. Hayden Christensen tries hard but he's either too stiff as Anakin or he's just annoying and, ultimately, he comes off as a sadistic creep. It's not like Al Pacino in the Godfather, where his character was a smart, honorable, well intentioned man who was blind-sided by his own ruthless ambitions. Then again, Christensen doesn't really have much to work with, does he?There are a few neat sequences - the hover chase after Jango Fett, the gladiator arena pitting Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padme against a bunch of beasts, the sight of a bunch of Jedi lighting up their light sabers (don't miss the Jedi who looks like a cone head and the green Jedi with the dread locks), and of course, Yoda's fight with Christopher Lee (but I could have done without the Bruce Lee crowing). However, I have a hard time believing that all these Force powered Jedi could get killed by mindless robots.Kind of makes you wonder how often George Lucas ventures out from his ranch.", "domain": "movies", "id": "ad771ddd90e458d4fdcc62f8dabd3239", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "thing", "nn_mod": "wrong", "q_reviews_id": "6503aa093337949893bdfd5899f29b4e", "query_asp": "performance", "query_mod": "better", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How was the performance?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "07be4fac516417922f8b55c84016fc03", "title": "B0000633ZP", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [433, 0], "text": ["The room (small suite) was large", "This hotel has great amenities"]}, "context": "This hotel has great amenities...great location... and generally excellent service.

Ask the waitress how are we suppose to share it, and she looks at me weird and said cut it and eat it. Second dish came the Fish Tacos, when we ordered it, she told me it comes in 3s, I'll just add 2 more in there for ya, we are quite prepared that it's gonna charge extra which is normal, but she should let me know how much they are. Had to guess it'll just be dividing the cost of 3 tacos and add 2 in there. When the Fish Tacos came, it came with an added bonus of a piece of hair, you can tell that it's not Hair on your head. we don't want to get into details about it, but after waiting yet another 10 minutes to spot Laura, we told her what happened and she did apologize (at least she did this right). She also apologized for the wait as she is WAITING for a coffee to be made. I asked for more water, didn't come.Other foods came as well, but there isn't really anything special, details about the food at the bottom.We ordered drinks after and waited ANOTHER 10 minutes for them. I don't know what it is about their drinks, whenever someone orders them, it's like they have to wait at the bar or something for drinks. I ask for water a second time, didn't happen.Spotting her refilling water with a jug nearby, we ordered food a second time after all the dishes came out, she took our orders and left an empty water jug on the table all the way till the end of the meal even though she had came to our table a few times. We ordered the Huarache Albanil (chorizo), but a dish came that don't look at all like Chorizo, and the server that brought it to us called it some other name that I didn't catch and then I ask her if it is chorizo and she said oh sorry, my bad, I meant to say Chorizo. We weren't buying it, so we waited yet another 5 minutes to ask Laura, and she confirmed that it is the wrong dish and look it away.I asked for water one final time with a tone of dissatisfaction, she came with water and an apology. She admitted it was terrible service throughout the meal and want to make up for it with 2 treats for my mom and brother since it's their birthday. It was 2 mini sponge cakes with whipped cream and some crumbled corn flakes on top. It was an extra wet sponge. Very sad.I asked for the bill and checked the bill, I saw the two tiny 2inch treats on the bill at 7 bucks each! I called her again and ask her what is this (pointing to the treats on the bill), she said oops! that was embarrassing! Had I not check it, what would happen?Finally, credit card machine. She hand it over to be but STOOD right beside me when I enter tips and everything as if she is afraid of not getting any tips. This is how terrible the experience was in terms of service.Managers and bosses of this establishment should really fire these people if they want to improve and charge people the prices they are asking for.Food was awesome, we ordered the following:1. Guacamole en la Mesa - which isn't all that special. Generous portion compare to all the other dishes.2. Atun - Tuna Ceviche, it was ok.3. Costilla Corta - a 24hr slow braised short rib on a menu that says for sharing and came out a bit larger than a golf ball. Sure, flavours are there, but very dinky.4. Pulpo Canitas - Confit of Octopus, This one is very good, very interesting flavours and sauces, worth it.5. Huarache Albanil - Chorizo on a torilla. What I love best about it is their black bean sauce, those are really nice.6. Baja Taco - GOTTA TRY IT, one of the best Fish Tacos I've eaten.

Unlike a map, it not only tells me where we're going, but it gives me suggestions and directions, like \"stay right\" or \"take the SECOND exit\". The programming and operation is easy, with just a little three-page manual to tell you all you need to know to utilize all of the Nuvi's features.

Make sure you update well in advance of any planned trip. (I suggest starting it at bedtime the night before.) The other gripe is that the suction cup mount really needs to be completely free of dirt and the windshield where you are attaching it sparkling clean. Any kind of residue on the glass or grit on the suction cup is going to send your Nuvi to the floor, where mine has been four or five times already.

The case is surprisingly light but still provides goodprotection. The inner case is rigid and provides an integral screen guardand a full coverage frame for the outer cover. The outer cover is softerand has flexible covers for the earphone, charger, and mute buttons. Thespeakers and microphone have clear passage ways for good sound performance. Onevery nice feature is that the case does not stick up very much beyond thescreen, this makes it easy and comfortable to hold. The extra width of thecase gives you a place for your thumb and prevents you from triggering thescreen. This is very convenient when holding the screen in landscape modeA few minor concerns: 1) The screen cover is integral to the case so itdoesn't appear to be individually replaceable. 2) there is no Smart Coverfunction to turn off the screen.Overall, a very nice case that serves to fully cover the ipad-mini and yet notinterfere with it's function.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "a541ffd9697ebf0ad9d226428594128e", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "texture", "nn_mod": "good", "q_reviews_id": "22b23446daf9d5bc0140be7278b220ee", "query_asp": "grip", "query_mod": "good", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the grip?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "84efbd9643d7f43af0ea0d2468c7dcc9", "title": "B00HNGB1YS", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "My husband and I spent a cozy evening at home last night, enjoying OCTOBER SKY. Based on the book Rocket Boys (BTW look at the two titles...OCTOBER SKY is an anagram of Rocket Boys), OCTOBER SKY is the story of a group of kids, growing up in a dying coal-mining town. The launch of Sputnik captures their imagination, and gives them all impetus to learn about rockets and make something more of their lives. With the help of a beloved teacher, the boys achieve their dreams and accomplish things never thought possible.While this story is old and familiar, OCTOBER SKY is sweet, comfortable, and very well done, keeping us interested in these characters and their lives throughout the film. You cheer for these kids, hope for their success, and are proud of their achievements. Sentimental and inspiring, OCTOBER SKY is perfect family fare. The acting is well done, the photography is lovely and wonderfully atmospheric, and the story right on target. If I have any criticism at all, it is that this film drags a bit in a few places. But, overall, OCTOBER SKY is a wonderful feel good movie.OCTOBER SKY reminds us all to go for our dreams, because you might just achieve them.

This is not a new story. Think a reverse Anne Frank without the naivete. But you've never read it like this.Markus Zusak uses the point of view of Death to tell the heartbreaking story of Liesel Meminger, a nine-year-old soon-to-be orphan at the beginning of the book. Death is intrigued by Liesel and follows her throughout her daily tasks for the five years during the war.Because of a promise made during another war, Liesel's foster parents take in a young Jewish man, hiding him in their basement. The young man and Liesel become friends by sharing words.This is a story of words: how they are used for creation and destruction, stolen and given, how they bring life to some and death to others. Markus Zusak cradles and loves every word he writes, just as Death cradles the souls he collects. The Book Thief brought me to tears more than once, not just because of my empathy and support of Liesel and her loved ones, but because of the sheer beauty of those words. There were several times that I had to stop reading, go back and reread a sentence slowly just to let it dance in color and brilliance between my eyes for a minute.The description of Death was chilling - not terrifying, mind you, but chilling. He was a likeable, realistic, empathetic, and surprisingly nurturing character who has a love / hate relationship with his job.I would highly recommend The Book Thief to anyone.

It contains an Ultraviolet version, which means a copy streamed from the internet and frankly a less convenient and popular way to watch digital movies. So, don't buy this expecting to be able to get a digital copy for your iTunes account.First, a disclaimer:I saw this movie in 3D in 48 frames per second. I had wanted to see it in non-3D at the regular 24 fps, but the tickets for that show were already sold out (even though the one I saw started a half hour earlier - I guess everybody else wanted to see the regular version too). In my opinion, the 3D made the movie too dark and the 48 fps made it appear too much like a TV soap, too fake. That obviously colored my impressions of the film. Despite this, I am reviewing the movie in general, not the 3D or 48 fps viewing, because you'll always have the option to view the movie in the regular version (as it should be viewed).With that said, here are some of my thoughts:STORY/BOOK ADAPTATIONI'm torn over how to assess the adaptation of the book. There are a lot of features I really liked and some I hated. Parts of the movie are very faithful to the book, and those parts generally work well. However, the changes to the book don't work nearly so well. While I was fine with the changes in the LOTR movies, the changes Jackson made in the Hobbit seemed unnecessary. Unlike in the LOTR films, where changes often condensed plot points because the books were too long, most of the changes in the Hobbit added to the story. Moreover, most of the changes in the Hobbit didn't do much to advance character development.***SPOILERS AHEAD***The movie takes an hour to get started with scenes of Bilbo talking to Frodo and then a flashback to the unexpected party. While I liked each scene individually, the frame narrative and the unexpected party took a bit too long. Unlike the intro scenes in the LOTR Fellowship of the Ring, there's a lot of dialogue but relatively little information revealed. Viewers learn surprisingly little about the dwarves or the quest (of course, aside from the excellent prologue scene featuring the attack on Erebor).Right after the Trolls, there's a scene in which a band of Orcs chase the dwarves (similar to the added chase scene in LOTR Two Towers with the men of Rohan and Orcs). This seemed like it was simply a way to heighten the tension and excitement in the film. However, it was wholly unnecessary as the Troll scene was frightening enough. The scene eventually has to be resolved through a series of awkward interventions, from Radagast outracing the Wargs on his bunny sleigh to a hunting party of Rivendell Elves. The whole sequence could have been cut with no loss.My biggest critique is the whole Azog subplot. In the book, Azog was an Orc chieftain during the Battle of Azanulbizar and was slain by Dain. He was also father of Bolg. That's it. However, now in the movie the Necromancer has revived Azog from the dead and he's got a grudge against Thrain. Obviously, Peter Jackson & Co felt like the film needed a chief villain, but Azog just becomes too much a part of the story. LOTR was excellent at putting an Orc chieftain in the spotlight for the purposes of creating a chief villain for a scene, without allowing them to become the focus of the scene (think Lurtz, Gothmog, etc). I'd have much preferred the excellent Goblin King to have played a larger role.I loved the Goblin Town and the Riddles in the Dark scenes. Goblin Town looked great, almost like a beehive. Despite my initial misgivings about the design of the Goblin King as a HUGE Goblin, I loved the character on screen. His mix of humor and threat fits the tone of the Hobbit perfectly. If anything, I felt he was underutilized.Riddles in the Dark was actually fairly faithful to the book. However, the choreography is superb, with the characters constantly moving, pacing, or confronting each other while reciting the riddles. The directing keeps the scene visually interesting without distracting from the riddling.Despite the press attention he got, I really didn't come away with strong opinions about Radagast the Brown. I thought Sylvester McCoy did a decent job playing the role, but he wasn't a highlight. I like the Dr. Doolittle motif of his talking with the animals. His sole role seems to have been informing Gandalf about Dol Guldur, but it's a bit confusing why Gandalf wouldn't know given that he had visited Thrain there. I do hope we get more of Radagast in the next two films, but I also won't feel I missed out on too much if we don't.***END SPOILER ALERT***As I said above, I felt overall the departures from the book didn't enhance the story, unlike the case with the LOTR films, where I could understand most of the creative decisions Jackson & Co made.CHARACTERS/ACTINGI generally have positive things to say here. Martin Freeman was a convincing Bilbo. While he's not nearly so lovable as the Hobbit quartet from the first film, he has some great humorous moments. However, where Freeman really shines is in his ability to mix the \"Took\" (adventurous) and \"Baggins\" (domesticated) sides of his nature seamlessly so to speak. Bilbo doesn't start off as just a timid burgher, and he doesn't just become an action hero. His character feels real.With a huge caveat. In the book, Bilbo's moment of decision and courage comes when he faces the spiders in Mirkwood. By contrast, in this movie, there is another moment at the end where Bilbo charges several Orcs. It seemed like a step a bit too far for the character at this point in the story. After all, it's one thing for him to attack spiders while he's wearing the ring, but another to attack huge Orc and Wargs without invisibility. The scene was a Jackson & Co. addition and it just didn't fit. I understand they wanted to end the movie with Bilbo having a heroic moment, but it went too far.I was pleasantly surprised by Richard Armitage's Throrin. I was a bit leery that he would be too much the action hero, but Armitage deftly gives Throrin a complex character - arguably more complex than Throrin's character in the book. Armitage's Throrin is coldly bitter, but also loyal towards his men. Armitage doesn't overdo the bitterness, but it's a presence on the screen.The other 12 dwarves really didn't get a chance to do much. As an ensemble, they worked well at the beginning in the unexpected party, making a mess of Bilbo's house. However, once they leave the Shire, only Kili and Bofur stand out. Bofur is obviously being set up as somebody who will develop a friendship with Bilbo, while Kili is often the dwarf used to advance plot points.I don't fault the movie for not distributing screen time more evenly. After all, in the Hobbit book, Tolkien basically ignores all of the dwarves aside from Throrin. Jackson probably does a better job incorporating the leftover 12 dwarves feel relevant. However, the group is not yet an ensemble. It feels like Bilbo, Throrin, Gandalf, Bofur, Kili, and a few other dwarves. Unlike the Fellowship of the Ring movie, viewers probably won't feel attached to every member of the group.SPECIAL EFFECTSGenerally, the film had the strong special effects we've all come to expect from Weta Workshops. Gollum looked even more realistic than he did in the LOTR movies. I though most of the CGI Goblins looked fine. The Misty Mountains Goblins were tiny and CGI was probably the right choice.However... Azog looked horrible. He was CGI and it showed. His body was far too smooth, just smooth and white. Basically, he looked like a Vampire Orc. The character had absolutely no stage presence when confronting the real actors.The other special effect critique was the size of the dwarves, particularly in Rivendell. Throrin goes from too tall to too short within a matter of minutes (when they're reading the Moon runes). It really pulled me out of the movie for a bit. I don't ever remember thinking about the size of the dwarves and hobbits in LOTR. That's something I hope Jackson corrects for the DVD release.OVERALLThe Hobbit is a worthy prequel to the LOTR films. Make no mistake, the Hobbit is NOT The Phantom Menace equivalent to the Original Trilogy. Nonetheless, I didn't come away nearly so wowed. Perhaps the expectations were set too high. Perhaps it's because I made the mistake of watching the movie in 3D and 48 fps. However, there were also some plot changes that I felt didn't add much. Ultimately, I think the Hobbit would actually have been better served as two rather than three films with the added scenes left on the cutting room floor.", "domain": "movies", "id": "c2422d537705d27473ed7e8388f53322", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "moment", "nn_mod": "great", "q_reviews_id": "16298b87bce59ba08d15807a33de6517", "query_asp": "fun", "query_mod": "more", "ques_subj_score": 0.20000000298023224, "question": "How much fun will I have?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "8cded940ba43d813521dd1cc0e58efa4", "title": "B0059XTU1S", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [288], "text": ["Room was large"]}, "context": "Searched for a hotel in our price range in the city and went with this recommendation from a friend.

It wouldn't be too difficult, what with Sunday School teachings, parents reading bible stories to them, and the pretty pictures and paintings that adorn the walls of every church and Sunday school hall.I don't think I'm trying to say Colton made everything up completely from scratch; I believe he did have some form of NDE, and maybe he really did see his Father praying to God when he felt so desperate and angry. What gets me is all the stuff that comes later.Kids have an imagination. Kids make things up-they don't necessarily consider it a bad thing, it just happens. Particularly when they discover that other people are expecting them to have answers. The majority of the time, Colton doesn't volunteer any information, which to me is pretty odd. I've babysat 3 to 6 year old kids and my own nephew isn't even two-but he babbles and talks constantly. So did the others. They told me all about their day without me asking and went into every detail they could remember. I also recall doing this myself; when I was excited by some new experience I went straight to my parents and talked-talked-talked. Colton, on the other hand, usually gives information only when it's asked for. This gives me the feeling that he's trying to come up with an answer on the spot based on knowledge or experience taught to him.I read another review on here where a reader pointed out that Colton enjoys play-battles and that he probably got the idea of his father \"going into a war\" from them. I gotta admit it's a good point. I was struck by the same thought in the scene where Colton's father jokes about they're not being any swords in Heaven, to which Colton seems to hitch himself up and say, almost indignantly, \"Oh Yes they DO have swords in Heaven!\" And sometime later he comments that a war will take place where people will fight with either swords or arrows. Kinda low tech for the human race, isn't it? But to me it wasn't unexpected, considering all this war business was brought up after he watched the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe movie. (BTW-I thought the author went into unnecessary detail about the Narnia plot. Who doesn't know about it, really? Looked like he was just trying to up the word count.)One of the more peculiar instances I found in the book was where Colton's father and wife look outside to see an astonishingly vivid and beautiful rainbow. They go outside to have a look, then summon Colton over, thinking he would enjoy it. But the kid comes out just long enough to say \"Oh yeah, I know, I asked God to send one,\" before he leaves to play. So...he prayed to God to send him a lovely rainbow, but spends all of what, 5 seconds, looking at it? He's not in the least surprised it's there, because apparently he knew it would come, but the book doesn't mention anything about him looking out for the rainbow beforehand, and he didn't seem all that impressed by it anyway. Either the kid's getting spoiled by all the \"signs\" God's sending him for his enjoyment, or maybe, just maybe, he's taken the chance to reinforce the idea into our heads that he's \"Been there, seen that,\" and has that special connection with our heavenly father.Again, I'm not suggesting Colton is deliberately lying or making things up because he's some devious little punk that wants to make fools of us all for buying into his stories. But I DO think a good chunk of it is indeed fabricated, that he's only relying on the truths taught to him by his Christian family to help support his and his family's particular beliefs. Like I said, I am a Christian and I certainly do believe there's a Heaven and God and Jesus and all that, but I can't take this book as credible evidence.To be fair, I've never died or had a NDE or an Out Of Body experience. I'm in no position whatsoever to say with 100% accuracy what is or is not on the other side. For all I know, it could very well be exactly as the Bible tells us-or it couldn't. I wouldn't know.All that's left to say is that, if there was just ONE thing about this book that may have gotten me a little miffed, it's this: I had to pay 6 bucks for this. This story has a VERY simplistic writing style, and it's short. I have nothing against simple and sweet, I even have a few others of that sort in my kindle library, but then, they were either freebies or 1-3 bucks. This was a little over 6. It really, truly wasn't worth the buy, at least not to me. I'm not angry I read the story, just that it should cost so much for so little.

Heck, if I'm comparing this book to others I might also. Though this is a far cry from my usual reviews of historical romances I finally took the plunge and read the book. I have to say that the author did create characters I was interested to learn more about. Much like the scarred earls of a historical, or even Edward in Twilight, this book has a wounded hero who uses his wealth and power to try and control the heroine. Much like heroines in the above mentioned novels, he doesn't quite succeed. What we have here is a typically plotted out romance novel with the addition of BDSM.Is this book erotic? Not so much for me. Is this book romantic? It can be in parts. I think the reason so many women love this book and the series is because some of us like when a man takes charge. Add the idea of nice cars, big houses and the absence of real life dilemmas and we all may be a bit smitten. Yes, the writing is child like. If it weren't for the BDSM subject matter I would say this book was written more for the teenage crowd. However, some parts are actually well written. The dialogue and the emails are quite funny in their own way. I laughed at some of those parts.What I am trying to say is that I took this book at face value and it was an interesting read. I can't guarantee I'll read the rest of the series with as much enthusiasm but I will read the other two books so I have a full review to give.

If you didn't care for the original 1933 horror classic, King Kong, it is doubtful you will warm to this mega version. That being said, this update is a marvelous, big production that entertains and excites without sacrificing any of its emotional substance. As escapist fare with heart, the new King Kong has blockbuster written all over it, and in this case that's a good thing, a very good thing indeed.It is Depression era in New York City where Carl Denham (Jack Black), a frustrated movie director, gambles that he can make a hit film on a remote island. Denham happens upon Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), an unemployed actress/comedienne, and casts her as his star. With some deception, he embarks on his filmic voyage with reluctant screenwriter, Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody). Arriving at uncharted Skull Island, the film crew ventures inland and is confronted by unfriendly natives who later kidnap Darrow as a human sacrifice. As Driscoll leads the ship's crew to rescue Ann, a gigantic, fierce gorilla called Kong approaches and seizes her. Driscoll and the others are in hot pursuit through a prehistoric land where they are attacked by gigantic creatures. Kong fights his way through carnivorous dinosaurs with his female captive in hand until they reach his mountain top lair. Kong is a vicious animal, but he also reveals a gentler side when tantalized by Ann's comedic and athletic talents. The two begin to form an unlikely bond. When Driscoll manages to rescue Ann, an enraged Kong chases them until Denham tranquilizes the beast. Now a major attraction on Broadway, Kong is a prisoner until he breaks free to wreak havoc while searching for Ann. When the two are reunited, it culminates atop the Empire State Building as Kong is attacked by warplanes in a heartrending finale.Does the new Kong justify the hype and expectations? Yes, it is the complete moviegoing experience. There are thrills, spectacle, humor, and a sense of heroic adventure, which are rare even in the post-Indiana Jones era. It would take the superhuman effort of a director like Peter Jackson (and writers Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh), who had just completed the legendary Lord of the Rings trilogy, to tackle this project. This is an old fashioned film that stays closely to the original script. That Jackson takes his time in quieter moments to develop his characters and never stumbles when the action starts is truly amazing. Just when you think our heroes are safe, a new danger pops up to keep you at the edge of your seat. He is a master showman of creative, funhouse perils, and when he does things, bigger is better. He re-imagines legendary sequences from the original and takes them to new heights. When Kong fights a dinosaur, he battles not two but three dinosaurs in a clash of the titans! Kong's rampage on Broadway reminds you of the Piccadilly Circus sequence in An American Werewolf in London. When he is reunited with Ann, the two communicate through unspoken language. It is a moment of truth that Jackson films with an eerie beauty. You just know Jackson is a romantic as he sets up his dawn raid at the Empire State Building and gives his biggest star a great sendoff that compares favorably to the original.As for Kong himself, the (CG) computer-generated effects are phenomenal as the broadest of emotions and the tiniest of mannerisms and facial nuances (like blinking his eyes) are eloquently captured. Imagine that, pathos from a CG creation!Literally a far cry from original star Fay Wray, Naomi Watts gives the best performance in emoting true feelings and playing off her giant ape convincingly. Adrien Brody displays the necessary heroics in a role that doesn't demand much more. Jack Black was bold casting, but his character doesn't always work. Although entertaining, his Denham is more calculating and morally ambiguous than actor Robert Armstrong's 1933 depiction.Technically the film is a marvel, and the art direction and special effects meld seamlessly together so that it is impossible to tell one from the other. Rarely do the effects look artificial except in the dinosaur stampede. The stunning visuals and fluid camera work are like eye candy, and many scenes are shot with a fresh perspective or point of view. Some of the action scenes are almost too much overkill, but Jackson gets away with it because his other scenes are so impressive.At three hours running time, it moves fairly well. It takes an hour to get to Kong, but when he does appear, the film becomes one big, nonstop chase. There are brief lulls, but credit Jackson with not rushing to an action scene and instead savoring the quiet moments that establish the most important relationship in the story. What's satisfying in the relationship between Kong and Ann is that it is one of companionship and love without the overt sexuality of the original.There are a couple of unsettling moments when Denham confronts the natives and a spider pit sequence that could be nightmarish for children. This pit sequence pays homage to a scene that was cut from the original and expands on the possibilities in nasty ways. If you thought Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom's insects were creepy, watch out!Jackson wows his audiences with his talent for managing enormous spectacles and imbuing them with humanity. This film verifies his prowess as one of the most gifted directors of his generation. Audiences looking for adventure of the highest order will find a lot to enjoy here.

But let's face it, how many films are so fresh and new that they delve into uncharted territory? In any case, don't care. Whether it's a drama, a comedy, a horror movie or even a romantic comedy, it's how well it is delivered that counts. And this film delivers.Like \"TRON\" the film is visually arresting. Seen on a big screen, the sets are huge but sparse, drawing the audience in. Set in a war-ravaged Earth of 2077 devoid of humans, all of whom have resettled on a moon of Saturn, only Jack (terrific Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) remain. They are partners (both romantic and professionally) whose mission is to watch over the drones that patrol the area for a smattering of \"Scavs\" who were the defeated invaders. While Earth won the war, they lost the planet which continues to be harvested for water and other ecological matter.Jack is the investigative repair man who goes out alone. Victoria never leaves their high control point and guides him using sophisticated tracking technology. While investigating an unusual radio beacon, Jack witnesses a spacecraft crash. One of the survivors is a human flight officer named Julia (Olga Kurylenko) who he has occasionally dreamed about. Both Jack and Vic have had their memories \"washed\" in order to eliminate thoughts of the terrible war. Uh, sure. What Jack believes to be \"Scavs\" turns out to be Beech (Morgan Freeman) and his collection of survivors. The truth is out there and Jack must find it, and does with the help of Julia.Like \"TRON,\" \"Oblivion\" is beautiful to watch and has a great soundtrack, mostly provided by French electronic band, M83. Yes, \"Oblivion\" borrows from a list of movies too long to mention, but for those of us who salivate for science fiction films with a breath of intelligence, this one does the trick.BLU RAY REVIEW: In this subsequent viewing of this terrific sci-fi film, I was able to tie up a few elements I didn't quite understand the first time around. I would also have to say this is one of the best looking movies of any genre I've seen. The special features on the Blu ray disc add some clarity on how and why the filmmakers went for a certain look and it truly comes across beautifully.The other thing I had missed the first time around was the romantic relationship between Jack and Victoria and subsequently Julia. It was there but just wasn't a point of focus. By \"there,\" I mean it wasn't explicit, either by subdued actions or love making. Regarding the later, the most interesting coupling occurs in the swimming pool. It seems clear that Jack's relationship with Victoria seems forced or maybe expected is a better word. He does all the right things that husbands and wives do, but it seems like a matter of routine more than true love. Watch Cruise's face during those intimate close ups. Something is wrong. Of course those memory flashbacks of Julia don't help. When Jack finally does find Julia, it all clicks. Not quickly, but you can see in Jack's reactions, he loves this woman. But why? In the end, he shows how much he loves her. \"Oblivion\" is also a beautiful love story.There is nothing like watching a beautiful movie like this on the big screen, but this Blu Ray transfer comes damn close. The 1080p transfer is spectacular in every respect and certainly will be a show off piece to a good system. It comes in the original aspect ratio of 2.39:1 and does a great job replicating the original film. The dystopian world is now essentially uninhabited and the stark whites and various shades contrast nicely with deep dark blacks. When the story moves underground, shadows and shadings of grey prevail. But even when Jack retreats to his cabin in the wilderness, we get beautiful greens and various earth tones in all their splendor. I could see no encoding issues. The contrast and detail are excellent.Equaling the visuals is a magnificent DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio track. Again put this one on your demo list. If you have sub-woofers, they will get a workout as the rumbles coming from many sources including gunfire, rockets and explosions. The surrounds are constantly in play with movement from side to side, back and forth as the drone ships fly around. Dialog is clear and well presented. Ambient noise is ever present as well.Extras include an excellent commentary track by Tom Cruise and director Joseph Kosinski, a 48 minute \"making of\" documentary, some deleted scenes and get this, an isolated musical score by M83 in Dolby TruHD 5.1 (24 bit, 96kHz).

However, I did not think the movie was that bad, but actually quite good. I do not think it is as good as the Lord of the Rings films, Narnia films, or the Harry Potter films, but still fairly enjoyable. Compared to the string of teen fantasy movies that have come out recently like Percy Jackson or Twilight this movie is god.The story is pretty simple. It takes place in the distant future. There was once a big civil war which has left North America in ruins. Instead of countries there now exists twelve districts. Each year the capital of Panem forces either a boy or a girl from each district to compete in the Hunger Games where they all battle to the death. From District 12 a girl named Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is chosen to compete along with her friend/love interest Gale (Liam Hemsworth).People accuse this film of ripping of another film called Battle Royale. Firstly I have not seen Battle Royale so I cannot say which film is better. Secondly, I'm sure that Battle Royale was not the first of its kind either. Everything is inspired by something. There have been movies and TV shows that have come out after this that have a similar premise of people put somewhere and are forced to fight to the death. For all anime fans out there, there is an anime that came out last year (the same year that the Hunger Games came out) called Btooom that has pretty much the same premise yet I do not see many people complaining that that show ripped-off Battle Royale.Plus the film is still well structured, well, acted, and can be entertaining. The characters are pretty solid. I do like Katniss and it is easy to sympathize with her given the situation. The stuff that she goes through is pretty scary and intense. I can say that I would be dead in the first ten minutes if I was put in the Hunger Games.The movie has some great effects, decent actions scenes, and an interesting world. I cannot comment on the 3D because I only saw the film in 2D. There is one complaint I have and that is the middle portion. I found much of the middle of the film to be kind of boring. The middle mostly focuses of the political aspect of this world and preparing Katniss for the games.Overall, the Hunger Games was a pleasant surprise. I did not expect much upon going to see it. I basically saw it because my mother made me see it. I have to admit it was much better than I thought it was going to be.

The adventures of Harry, Ron and Hermeine are documents for everyone's enjoyment. The book is a quick-read, enjoyable and a good follow-up to the first Harry Potter book. You can tell J. K. Rowling has created an interesting world that you want to know more about.Setting:The strength of the Harry Potter series is in the new fantasty world created by J. K. Rowling -- a twist on the normal and fey world...magically with humans and beasties vs. non-magical people. The book does an ok job of describing the world; the scene designers and artists for the movies have done a tremendous job of filling in this world. If you would not have the context of the movies, the books descriptions seem lacking to me.Characters:The character development is interesting and decently done through the mixture of the characters actions in a wide range of moral dilemnas and dangerous situations. The use of consequences for the characters actions is lightly done but it is nice to see that being done still.Plot:The plot is tight and well-thought out. The story is linear but it makes sense for the target age range for the books. Clearly, J. K. Rowling has developed a complex story line with this just being an element on the storyline -- the develop of background comes through.Action:The action is quick and to the point -- a nice feature for a book where you want to find out more about the setting as well as have the characters advance along in school to get more developed, more interesting/multi-faceted and see how the dynamics of various characters evolve.Prose:The prose style is clean, simple and effective. The simplicity vs the effectiveness of the prose shows a good command of the English language and a distinctive enjoyable style. It is not a great literary work by any stretch of the imagination but one does not expect that from this type of book.Summary:Setting: 3.5 to 4 stars -- I would give it 5 stars but only because of the world created and desribed in the movies but the book descriptions are thin and not well developed.Plot: 4 stars -- good for a child's bookCharacters: 3.5 starsAction: 3 starsProse: 3 to 3.5 stars", "domain": "books", "id": "14ae926ff07a32ca5655d7f379f265f1", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "story", "nn_mod": "linear", "q_reviews_id": "693c773eebae744dab86322aac72b5c1", "query_asp": "future", "query_mod": "bleak", "ques_subj_score": 0.125, "question": "How is the future in that story?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "c5efbfd98c6f3c23fa40b01db4c54de5", "title": "0439064864", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Everyone should see this film.

It's right in the middle of some great shopping! Overall we enjoyed our stay with a few little hiccups along the way.The minor issues: 1. The hair dryer in the room was fried and we called the front desk to get a replacement. It never came. We had to call a second time before we got a replacement. The good thing is that at least on the second call we got a response within 15 minutes.2. We cancelled a wake-up call but they called anyway - twice. My husband was there on a conference and I chose to sleep late one morning but the wake-up call he cancelled came anyway and woke me up at 4:30am.The major issue:My husband was in the room taking a break from his conference and I was in the shower. We had the privacy sign out on the door and the privacy lock engaged. The mini-bar attendant (a man) took the sign off the door and wedged it on the wall behind our room number. He knocked briefly and then tried to come right on in. The lock prevented the door from opening more than 4 inches. Initially I was upset because if the privacy sign is out it generally means you don't want to be disturbed. The second reason I was upset was that if my husband wasn't in the room at the time and I had forgotten to engage the privacy lock, ... fill in the blanks. Since the shower is right next to the hotel door you can clearly hear it outside in the hall. My only assumption is that either the employee was trying to walk in on something or he simply disregards people's privacy.In my opinion I think this is a serious security concern. When we discussed it with a member of management, she seemed concerned and said she'd speak to the staff and security about the incident.What's interesting is that between the first phone call to the manager and the time I left the room an hour later, it happened a second time. I happened to be at the door about to go out and saw him through the peep hole. He removed the privacy sign from the door and wedged it on the wall again and then knocked. At least this time he didn't try to enter our room.Just be aware of this when thinking of booking your room there. The main lesson to learn is to always put the privacy sign out and to engage the privacy lock when you don't want anyone barging in. This could have happened at any hotel room in the world so take this lesson with you anywhere you choose to stay.Now for the fun stuff:Grand Views lounge on the 36th floor is worth the view but you'll get sticker shock when ordering any drinks. A plain martini is $12 and it had too much vermouth in it. I couldn't finish it because it was horrible but you won't go wrong with wine or beer. This is a great place to go for a quick cup of coffee to enjoy the view but there are better places to get a drink.Perry's Downtown:This place makes a great burger and is a good place to go for drinks or a good burger and a beer. It's about 2 1/2 blocks away from the Hyatt. It's a good lunch place and a good casual dinner place and is reasonable on the wallet.Steps of Rome Trattoria:North BeachThis is the best Italian food!! I had the Gnocchi alla Serentia and it was fantastic! The place doesn't look like much but the people are friendly and the food is wonderful!Pizza Chicago:Ghiradelli SquareGreat pizza joint in a casual atmosphere. Reasonable and worth every penny!La Suite:On Brannan near the Bay BridgeAmazing french food!!! It's in a higher price range but the food is awesome! The bar is trendy, the drinks very generous and the staff is friendly.Hawthorn Lane:I'm not sure where it's located but the food and atmosphere were amazing. This is among the highest priced restaurants in the city but if you love good food and excellent service this is the place for you. I had the lobster - mmm mmm!Alcatraz evening tour:Ok, so I'm not into cheezy tourist stuff but I enjoyed this tour. If for nothing else, go for the views of the city. It's a neat piece of history to check out and has incredible views of the city, the Golden Gate, Angel Island and the Bay Bridge. Bring the tripod though, and turn off the flash if you're using a small tourist digital camera for a great shot.Getting around:We only used taxi services to get to and from SFO and to go out to nicer restaurants. The rest of the time we relied on Muni buses and Cable Cars. Make sure you get a good map of the routes and stops first and you'll be prepared to get anywhere. You'll find more tourists on the cable cars and locals on the buses. You'll also find that peak times (especially weekends) will mean full cable cars and longer waits to get on.Presidio and the Golden Gate:You can either drive or take the bus to the Presidio up to the Golden Gate. There are several photo spots to get some great photos so explore further than just the initial upper level and you'll find some really pretty areas.Palace of Fine Arts:The rotunda is really pretty as was the area surrounding it.

Each night between 5 and 6 you get a free glass of wine, and after that drinks are pretty reasonably priced (for a City centre hotel). We didn't eat in the restaurant so can't comment. On the day we checked out they let us have our room for an extra couple of hours at no charge.One thing that hasn't been mentioned on trip advisor (that I can see) is that if you go to their website and let them have enough notice, they will arrange a free of charge personal tour with a Golden Gate Greeter. This is really worth doing - our guide was great and spent half a day showing us around - you tell them what you want to see/ your interests - and they tailor it to you.I would definitely recommend this hotel.", "domain": "tripadvisor", "id": "ddc2f2e1a963d1cd6a30303960bcc2c3", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "location", "nn_mod": "fantastic", "q_reviews_id": "ad030833a7038c5550ead4d55565a11f", "query_asp": "location", "query_mod": "fabulous", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the location?", "question_subj_level": 3, "review_id": "tripadvisor_review_2631", "title": "usa_san francisco_hotel_rex", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Much too long...especially about all the drugs taken in Las Vegas.

We were able to walk a couple blocks to get to Fisherman's Wharf - a great area to stroll around and browse the various seafood, shops, and views off the piers. We were able to get to Chinatown with a 15 minute walk. The two things I loved about this hotel - the breakfast buffet and the outdoor firepits. Outside there are several semi-private sitting areas, each of which included a firepit. We bought a bottle of wine and just chilled outside, a fantastic and cozy way to finish off the night. The next morning, the breakfast buffet was pleasantly surprising. They offered small personal frypans with cooked veggie omelettes and home fries. My gf got a strawberry yogurt parfait while I was scooping up the salmon lox with capers. There was plenty of the standard continental fare in addition to the fresh mixed fruits.

For those select few who don't know the story, Harry Potter is the son of two legendary wizards, who was hidden with distant relatives, in order to protect him. Until his eleventh birthday, he had no idea that he was famous or had the potential to be the most power wizard the world has ever known. Potter is invited to join the Hogwarts school of wizardry and that is when the adventure begins. British Actor, Daniel Radcliffe, plays Potter and is nothing short of spectacular. Before the Potter films, Radcliffe had very limited acting experience and many say, he got the part, because of his resemblance to Harry Potter on the cover of the book. That may be how he got the part, but he defiantly shows he has the talent to go along with the right look. His performance was terrific, but there is something to be said about having the right Director, and Christopher Columbus was the perfect choice. Columbus has a ton of experience working with young newcomers in films with high expectations. Overall, the story is extremely well written, the young cast was refreshing and full of energy, the direction was stellar, and the set, costumes, and effects were some of the best I've ever seen. I'm not going to go run out and join a quitage team, but I am going to see the rest of the series.

According to the included manual, on the Home page of Seagate dashboard there is a \"protect\" button to start the backup process. I never got this button to show itself.* The other major selling point of the Dashboard is the ability to backup data/images from Facebook, Flicker and YouTube. I am not quite sure why I would want to do this, and my natural paranoia keeps me from giving Facebook any sort of access to anything having to do with my local drive. To its credit, the Dashboard software seems to allow disabling of this access. Still-just makes me nervous-I don't trust Facebook to be anywhere near my personal drive.* Installing the Dashboard software seemed to load a LOT of software-look like a whole Microsoft C++ distribution kit. The uninstall seems to mostly work (it did throw an error for a file not found.

There are quite a few games designed for adults filled with puzzles and brain teasers that will change your view of computer games. No matter who you are or how adult you think you are: you will wind up using this thing for games. It's too fun to play games on it not to. I recommend Labyrinth 2 HD, Osmos HD, Pinball HD, tChess Lite, and a good Solitare game.Back to getting work done: it's pretty great for email. I have a work blackberry and a personal iPhone. I get lots of spreadsheet and other document attachments. Blackberry is terrible at displaying documents. Iphone does an OK job. This thing is a desktop replacement as a document viewer. It isn't as good as having MS office on a PC, but you can definitely get a great view of a document with a lot of formatting intact. It isn't really better than iPhone for viewing messages, but viewing attachments on the big screen is worlds better. The only complaint I have about email is that it lacks the ability to thread conversations and show all email inboxes in one list like the ios4 iphone devices. It will have those abilities this fall when it gets upgraded to ios4, but for now switching between inboxes is a bit awkward.More on document viewing.The biggest help to me at work is document viewing. I can carry promotional materials, examples of past promotions, old communications, files for reference, presentations, price lists, spec sheets, manuals, photos, trade journals, books, and any other digital document imaginable and access them all easily when with a customer or simply to find info to make me more effective. The iPad does not include a file system like finder or windows explorer. The iWork apps have a documents folder, but those folders are not accessible by other apps. All of the apps include a shortcut to open a document in other apps, but not having a universal finder app is annoying. If you are in mail you can choose to open an attachment in Pages then email any changes back to the person, but it goes against the way we have all become accustomed to working on PCs and Macs. There are file system and viewer apps. I've tried two I like and one that I highly recommend: Goodreader. Goodreader gives you a place to organize your files into folders for various projects and info. It has viewers for office file formats, PDF files, and limited graphics files (sorry, there are no eps, ai, or similar art viewers for ipad that I've discovered yet). Goodreader allows you to transfer files to the ipad via wifi networking, wifi using a web browser on a PC or Mac, using the USB cable, or using itunes. Best thing about Goodreader: it's only one dollar.The built-in photos app is great. I used my mac to convert a lot of documents to jpgs just so I could use the photos app to view and display them. Integration between the photos app and the iwork apps and mail is great. Syncing albums between a Mac or PC and the Photos app is a snap. The photos app is where the \"magical\" in the ads comes from. It is a delight to browse images using the app. I'm sure you can find countless youtube videos demonstrating it if you look. For under five dollars, you can buy Photogene or a similar app for useful photo editing on the ipad.Web browsing is the other \"killer app.\" Lots of people complain that iPad doesn't support flash, but I honestly don't miss it. Most big web sites recognize that you're using an ipad and deliver non-flash versions of videos. My biggest concern is the lack of RAM in the ipad. The lack of RAM shows when web browsing. If you switch between open pages, most of those pages will be reloaded because it doesn't cache much; it can't cache much with only 256mb of ram. As long as switching between pages, and having them reload when doing so isn't a huge issue to you, web browsing on the ipad using Safari is a desktop-like experience. I have just recently started using a third party browser called \"Atomic Web.\" Atomic web adds useful multitouch gestures, tabs, full screen, and adblock to the Safari browser. I highly recommend Atomic Web for the $2 they charge for it. It works great.The app store lets you add tons of functionality to your machine. Count on spending $50+ depending on what you want to do with your machine. I love the three $10ea iWork apps, the $5 photo editor, the handful of $5-$10 games I own, and the multitude of free periodical reader apps I downloaded.Watching and listening to media in ipad is really great. The iPod interface looks like an older version of iTunes on a Mac. Video looks great. I've always been a fan of desktop itunes for syncing with ipod and iphone. Ipad is exactly like iphone and ipod when interacting with the desktop. The built in speakers in ipad are louder and sound better than iPhone and iPod touch. They are nearly as loud as the ones on my Macbook Pro 13\". The speakers are great for listening to podcasts or watching a movie in bed or in your comfy chair.Google maps and google earth are a desktop-like experience on ipad.Battery life is where ipad kicks laptop tail. I easily get 8+ hours from a charge.Typing on ipad in landscape mode is about like typing on a netbook; you wouldn't want to write a long document on it but it's fine for email and composing short documents and memos. It's a lot better than I expected. Typing in portrait mode is a bit of a chore.You WILL need to buy a case for it. The \"acase\" brand ipad case that sells for $26 here at Amazon is a great choice (and the highest rated case on Amazon). You will not be able to find an Apple case for it. Apple cannot meet demand for ipad accessories. The camera connection kit (usb and card reader) are also impossible to find.I'm glad I bought the largest (64GB) model. I currently only have 25GB free after putting in 20GB of music, 8GB of films, 5GB of apps, and around 2GB of documents. 64 GB is really very ideal, but anything less would be crowded unless you don't plan to use the ipod or video player much.I bought the 3G service for it and don't regret it. I live in the midwest and ATT has decent service here. I am paying $15/month (no contract) for 256MB. 2GB is available for $25/mo. I bought the cheaper plan because I have frequent access to wifi, but wanted the ability to look at email adn documents on the road if the occasion arises. So far just using 3G for email and very infrequent browsing 256mb is plenty. I highly recommend buying a 3G model unless you are sure that you will always have Wifi access when you use it. It's a lot less useful if you can't connect to the web.In conclusion, this thing is very useful and very expensive. I use it a lot. I use my PC and my Mac a lot less now. I carry it to places that I wouldn't consider lugging a PC to. It allows me to carry a lot more info and digital files than I ever did before. It makes me more effective and allows me to travel lighter. Is it worth slightly over $1000 after buying a case and apps? I'm still not 100% sure.

The Clark Kent alter ego makes the story interesting. Instead they make Clark out to be some drifter with no purpose in life. What nonsense!!Also, what made the original Superman movie (and other big budget films of the 70s like Star Wars and Close Encounters) was that less is actually more. Its time for Hollywood to get off its CGI addiction and get back to simple, down to earth special effects. Back then, the production effort was spent on characters, storyline and special effects. These days its all about the visual graphics and not about the story. Its a direction for disaster.

Even in Atlanta, Georgia it is now playing in one midtown theatre in a neighborhood where there are more rainbow flags visible than flannel shirts.The film is beautiful to watch if a bit too long. That is to be expected since Mr. Lee had the task of fleshing out a short story into a two hour movie. It is easier to express passage of time with two sentences than on the big screen with two characters who essentially are nonverbal, a second problem as the director had to show a lot of what was going on between the two lead actors with only body language and facial expressions. Additionally, in the short story by Annie Proulx that Mr. Lee and Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana based this movie on the men are not particularly attractive. For instance, in the Proulx account Jack Twist has buckteeth; there ain't nothing buckteeth about Jake Gyllenhaal's smile. He is almost too handsome although he does put on weight as the years pass by.These are minor complaints, however. The movie should not be missed, not only by gay audiences but by the rest of America as well. Both lead actors do a fine job as do the minor characters, particularly Jack Twist's wife. The message is clear: in 1963 in Wyoming-- as in the rest of America-- two masculine \"Malboro\" men could not have had an open relationship. If they had been hairdressers and town outcasts, maybe. On the other hand, love in whatever form it takes is not to be missed. Isn't that what living is all about anyway?While Mr. Lee, who by the way, is one of our best and most innovative directors-- he never repeats himself-- deviates some from Proulx's story, he keeps the essence of it. In the very end of the movie he adds a poignant touch by having Ennis hang his shirt outside Jack's on the same hanger in his closet, something, as I recall, he does not do in the story.The soundtrack is worth listening to as well, particularly Willie Nelson's version of \"He Was A Friend of Mine.\"We can only hope that the movie gets to a wide audience in Wal-Mart and K-Mart land, where these two men and their families lived.", "domain": "movies", "id": "9770b9c20be4419820ae4c284757d196", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "message", "nn_mod": "clear", "q_reviews_id": "d08c4a7e65c6de52a67b42da3de47171", "query_asp": "effect", "query_mod": "profound", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is effect?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "0866ef643adc933b78b775e4808eb285", "title": "1417030321", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [120], "text": ["The food was absolutely divine"]}, "context": "I felt the most fancy when I went here.

Thanks to Fiennes' uber-talent as a powerhouse actor, he helps pull the entire production up several rungs. Knightley shines unexpectedly bright in her role as the clothes-designing Duchess who steps into royalty and a marriage of the times; that is to say, something completely foreign to those of us in today's world.By contract, she is to be honorable and deliver the Duke an heir: a son. But three girls later and the Duke is becoming restless. He finds lust wherever his loins take him and the Duchess must simply bear it. A friend and confidant, Bess (Hayley Atwell), soon turns into a lady of conflict as she sleeps with, and then moves in with, the Duke. The Duchess tries to settle the matter but the Duke's power won't allow her any leeway.When a past love arrives in the Duchess' life, a powder keg erupts. Mr. Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper,Mamma Mia!) turns the Duchess' life upside down, and when she becomes pregnant with his child, the Duke's orders force her into an impossible situation: give the baby up (and give up Mr. Grey) or never see your children again.The terrible power wielded by The Duke is pulled off exceptionally well thanks to the high performance of Ralph Fiennes. Surprisingly you loathe him and then, as the film progresses, you actually pity him when he says things like, \"Look at them. To be that free.\" His job and title have strapped him down and drove him into this role.The forced and eventual consummated acceptance of the Duke's power is probably Keira Knightley's strongest reveal for her since I've been watching her flicks.The costumes and sets are stunning in their elegance and appropriateness, as is the believable love that future Prime Minister Grey (yes, he actually becomes Prime Minister) and the Duchess feel for one another, even when forced apart by society and their own lives.This is a wonderfully done film with plenty of eye-candy sets and dark characters to make most movie watchers delight.", "domain": "movies", "id": "829bed39c0f44f21c17fb68e3b7ef7b5", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "set", "nn_mod": "stunning", "q_reviews_id": "ab41b5fa3695855dfc5eff0a5997f0a9", "query_asp": "costume", "query_mod": "stunning", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How was the costume and the actors?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "6df55387f3872e01d9b4bf10f0660e0b", "title": "B001L57ZZG", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [585, 13], "text": ["The breakfast was a bit expensive", "the Adagio at the beginning"]}, "context": "We stayed at the Adagio at the beginning of August.

The person on the front desk was friendly and professional and swiftly checked us in. Our room was beautiful (superior king). It was a large room with a fresh contemporary design. The bathroom was luxurious - a sunken bath, a shower with good pressure (a must!), large sink with a large well lit mirror; and the toilet was discretely tucked behind a dividing wall.Other reviewers have expressed concern about the noise so I felt I should comment on this. Our room looked onto a side street and although there was some noise, I only noticed this on the first night - for me it was just a case of adjusting to the city. Daytime concierge was very friendly and helpful - although we were given misinformation in terms of the nearest MUNI stop.A word on room service - in the morning the service was excellent - be aware that there is a wider room service menu than the room card would suggest - I made the mistake of thinking the breakfast choices were very limited and later discovered that there were more choices in the hotel welcome book! Regardless, the service was efficient and friendly. However, the same cannot be said for evening room service. We called down for room service at about 10:30pm and received no response; concierge picked up the phone and he said he would call us back, but no return call was made!

I loved how Donna Tartt brought this story to us and how she set up Theo's point of view on everything. She really captures the struggles of an adolescent boy after losing his mother. The story follows Theo during the events of the tragedy and follows closely to what happens to him afterwards, looking for a home to stay in, reuniting with his father and trashy Las Vegas girlfriend, his friendship with Ukrainian Boris, and his return to New York to live with Hobie.Theo's life is kind of full of tragedy, so this book isn't a real upper, but it was thoughtfully provoking to see how this tragedy shaped his life, and how his actions had an effect years after they took place.In some places the story was a bit slow and drawn out, then Tartt completely skips over Theo's life in college (with some references as to those years later on), but all in all, this book is amazing. Everything she writes in this story has its place that you'll see by the end.It took me a while to get through it, but it is a pretty massive book in its own right. It always drew me back in and I was always wanting to know what would happen next. There was dullness to Theo's life that would be quickly turned to excitement as events happened and Theo's world continually turned upside down.I am pleased to hear that this book won the Pulitzer as it was a fantastic story set up perfectly by Tartt.

The kind you don't have to argue about. It's there in quantity for any need you might have. That aside, I see this SRMT as 2 headphones in one (a bargain BTW) - the extra-bass model for gaming, TV action film, house and other bass-centric music, and the hi-fi model (using bass reduction) for symphonies, folk and acoustic, jazz, rock/pop/metal, and other such delicate genres. Unless otherwise noted, all comments below apply to the SRMT using bass reduction, since I listen to music only, and my tastes are mostly towards neutral reproduction.The SRMT sounds to me like a blend of two other headphones I have - the Marshall Monitor and the Beats Mixr. The SRMT's bass is extra strong like the Mixr, and when bass reduction is used, still has a stronger bass (including the deep bass) than most so-called high fidelity headphones. The rest of the range above the upper bass sounds more like the Marshall - darker than the Mixr, especially in the &#34;presence&#34; region or lower treble. Most other reviews I've read of the SRMT don't describe the sound very precisely, comparing to other known references like the Mixr, or even the old school headphones like the Sennheiser and Beyer models. I have a feeling that any critical reviews of the SRMT by the best-known establishment reviewers will find the combination of extra strong bass and some shyness in the lower treble - that will take points off of their ratings for this headphone.In my case, using bass reduction for critical listening at home, the balance is perfect, or as near perfect as anything else I have, and that's excellent. The sound overall has a darker tonality than the average headphone, including the Beats Mixr, and it's about the same as the Marshall Monitor. The reasons I believe the SRMT is a 2-headphones-in-1 bargain is because 1) The SRMT's sound using bass reduction is excellent, with no bothersome peaks or dips anywhere in the music frequency spectrum; 2) The sound played flat (no EQ) provides the extra bass that gets lost in many portable use situations - outdoors or on public transport for example; and 3) Where most &#34;bassy&#34; headphones don't have the extra strength in the deep bass that they have in the upper bass, and using bass reduction with those headphones results in a weak lower bass, the SRMT's lower bass remains solid with good impact. The only other headphones I recall having this good of a bass response are the v-moda M100 and the Beats Mixr.The overall sound of the SRMT is very smooth from top to bottom. Unlike some reviewers who go into minute detail about the many aspects of sound the customer is likely to experience with their new headphone, I stick to the things I can explain - the things that anyone can hear on their music player, computer, or portable headphone amp etc. Besides having a bass response that's solid and detailed (given the things I noted above), and a midrange that's just right (neither forward nor recessed), the SRMT's treble is also ideal - just strong enough with enough detail for reproducing the fine upper harmonic detail in voices and instruments, but not so strong as to make sibilants or other treble irritations from lower-quality music tracks bothersome. I rarely say anything about amps except that they improve the sense of space or &#34;air&#34;, but with the SRMT and my USB DAC/amps, the highs dried up more than when playing with the iPod alone, and I got better results with the FiiO E07k through the 'Aux' port.The SRMT's soundstage seems at least average, which is good for a closed-back headphone. Isolation also seems average for a closed headphone, and the leakage is low - low enough that playing the SRMT at a moderate volume level in a cubicle next to other cubicles in a quiet office should not be a problem. The music track examples listed below will tell my impressions of the SRMT's sound with that particular music. If you should happen to read other reviews on the SRMT that describe either the mids or treble as recessed, consider that those reviewers are playing the SRMT with the bass full up and that I'm using bass reduction. The reason I'm not reviewing the sound of the SRMT played flat (no EQ) is because many other reviewers have already done that, and I want to provide an alternative for customers who'd like to have a headphone like the SRMT, but wouldn't like extra-strong bass.The SRMT comes in several colors, and my video review shows the plain black version I purchased. The SRMT seems to be mostly plastic, including the headband I think, but the headbands are user-replaceable and are easily found at retail stores. I consider the build quality to be as good as the sound - excellent. The earcups are circumaural (around-ear), and they fit around my average or larger size ears with great comfort. There are 2 main classes of circumaural earcups in my experience - the large round cups like the Beyerdynamic DT770 and other Beyer series, or the Soundmagic HP100 and HP200, to name some examples. Then there are the smaller oval earcups/earpads like the Sennheiser Momentum, the Phiaton MS400, the v-moda M100, and the SRMT. The SRMT fits me better with greater comfort than any of these other small oval earcup/earpad designs.The headband clamp is fairly light for this type of headphone, and it's also very secure on the head, but the snug and secure fit may have a price - in very warm weather the earcups may feel overly warm. The 4-ft. straight cable is detachable and double-side entry, and the 2.5mm plug that goes into each earcup looks like a stereo plug, although the extra connector may have something to do with the start/stop and volume controls. The other end for the computer or music player is an Apple-style right-angle miniplug. The SRMT doesn't come with any sort of carry case, just a thin plastic-coated bag that won't protect the headphone from anything. If you need to take this headphone with you to various places and you don't want to wear it around your neck (that works very well BTW), I'd advise taking it apart - earcups and headband and cable - and packing them into whatever protective container you can find.In other reviews I've done I've included the following music examples with comments about how the headphones sound with each track. My suggestion is instead of reading each one as an absolute unto itself, you could compare my notes here to other reviews and see how the SRMT compares with each individual track. I copied these examples from my Beats Mixr review and then went through each one in a listening session, checking for any differences I heard from what I reported for the Mixr, and found only one or two minor differences - an excellent result. The SRMT is now one of my 4 favorite headphones, which includes the Beats Mixr, the Marshall Monitor, and the v-moda M100.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth should have good detail and tone, and both male and female vocals should sound natural, without favoring either. The SRMT plays this perfectly.Ben Heit Quartet - Suite-Magnet and Iron (Jazz with a Bebop flavor): The piano that leads off should sound realistic, and the sax should sound soft. The SRMT plays this music extremely well.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice should be crisp and well-balanced, and there should be a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The SRMT reproduces the space and detail very well.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): Another track with plenty of space around the voice and instruments, making for a very pleasant stereo image. The voice sounds good and the tambourine in the background is clearly identifiable.Crystal Castles - Wrath of God (Electro-Pop): The moderate level of bass in this track should reproduce with good detail, and the ambient electronic effects should maintain their separation and never congeal into a glassy, hard, or &#34;ringy&#34; sound as some headphones might produce if they have uncorrected resonances. The SRMT does this one just right.DJ Shadow - Building Steam With a Grain of Salt (Electronic/DJ): This track opens with what sounds like very high and very low piano notes, and those high notes particularly might ring a few resonances in lesser headphones. The SRMT handles those notes well, and reproduces the ambient voices with good tone and balance.Franz Ferdinand - Ulysses (Pop-Rock): The moderate level of bass in this track should reproduce with good detail, and the percussion and voice should be crisp and well-balanced. The SRMT makes this sound like what I imagine the original producers heard when they mixed it.Halie Loren - Sway (Jazz vocal): Bass instrument(s) here may sound boomy with some headphones, but the SRMT handles this perfectly. The trumpet should sound natural but soft, and the voice should have the right presence without sounding recessed or too forward. The SRMT does a great job in both respects.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion hits hard here, and the SRMT handles it well. The bass tones beginning around 0:45 into the track are the ultra-deep &#34;shuddery&#34; kind that require good deep bass response from a headphone, and the SRMT reproduces those deep notes even with bass reduction enabled as described above.Kaskade - 4am (Electro-House): The bass that kicks in around 1:01 into the track is subtle, but the SRMT gets it right. The percussion and female voice should balance well with neither overwriting the other, and the SRMT aces this.Katy B - Perfect Stranger (R&B-House-Garage;): The heavy bass that begins at 0:27 into this track is played very well by the SRMT. The voice is slightly forward, but it doesn't overpower the instruments or get lost in the mix. The SRMT balances the different elements in this music extremely well.Machine Gun Kelly - All We Have (Rap/Hip-Hop): The heavy bass beats that begin at 0:23 into the track should sound like drum impacts, although they're not sharp impacts. The male and female voices should have a good balance and not overpower the music or sound recessed. The SRMT plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Massive Attack - Angel (Trip-Hop): This track begins with a steady low-frequency sound and some solid deep-bass impacts. The voices should blend well with the music and have just the right presence, although the recorded quality of the instruments isn't great. The SRMT plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Morcheeba - Bullet Proof (Trip-Hop): Bright percussion and medium-strength bass impacts make up most of this, with some dance-club spoken intonations thrown in. The SRMT renders the percussion treble correctly (not too bright, not harsh), and the voices sound just right.Peter Tosh - Get Up Stand Up (Reggae): The bass here has a decent but moderate impact, and the lead and backup voices have good separation that's not too narrow or wide. The SRMT renders the bass with good detail and the voices sound very natural.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are also some &#34;clip-clop&#34; effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The SRMT reproduces all of these sounds faithfully.Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C-Sharp Minor Op3 No2 (Classical, Piano): Grand piano played mechanically from an original recording by the master himself. The bass is light here, but the piano tone is good quality, and the SRMT plays these notes very well.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the SRMT renders the tones and transients superbly.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are unusually strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The SRMT delivers the impacts with proper weight, and makes the horns sound real.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string(?) tones beginning at 0:18 are subtle, but clearly reproduced by the SRMT. The bass isn't very strong, but still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, sounds so perfect that this track could easily have been mixed using the SRMT headphone.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "69bcfaf3e1461aacc0065a991a0093c6", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "balance", "nn_mod": "good", "q_reviews_id": "ddaadd6c684901ce5856d27cfb42cfa3", "query_asp": "balance", "query_mod": "perfect", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "What about balance ?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "cb843c369ccd6e07bc551526fd615931", "title": "B00B1NN0TS", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [509, 509], "text": ["The front desk staff was extremely rude", "The front desk staff was extremely rude"]}, "context": "We stayed at this hotel for two nights on a vacation.

We stayed in the Pan Pacific hotel located near Union Square. It is absolutely perfect and we will never stay anywhere else when we visit San Francisco again. It is a bit pricey, but it is totally worth it. The concierge and valet are very friendly and will do anything for you. We lost our cell phone the first day there and they called all the airport shuttles and the airport to track the phone. Eventually our phone was returned from a cab driver and delivered to a valet at the hotel, who held on to it until we returned from dinner. Out of 21 floors, we stayed on the 20th floor. The room was large, the bed was extremely comfortable, and the bathroom was amazing! In the beautiful bathroom were robes, a small television, big mirrors, a telephone, a large tub and a separate shower. We also had our own personal butler simply by pressing a button. Our butler brought us sugar and salt for our food, 10 extra hangers, extra towels, and even gave us bath beads/salts for our bath. The hotel staff members are experts on San Francisco. For every question we had, and we had a lot of them, the staff had a prompt reply. They supplied us with maps, directions, and recommendations. Even after they stopped a taxi for us, they wiped down the seats to make sure they were not wet since it had been raining a lot. Every time that we wanted to go eat the concierge recommended great places. The hotel's restaurant was great for breakfast also--even though it was a bit pricey, it was the BEST we had in San Francisco. One day we rented a car, which our hotel set up for us. The car was from Hertz, which is literally right across the street and was luxurious -a 2006 Toyota Avalon with everything. If I HAD to name two cons: flat screen tv could have had a better picture and we would have liked the hotel to have a pool (even though we had access to one with a fee).It was great, we didn't want to leave the hotel, and we loved our visit!THANKS to everyone at Pan Pacific for making our stay in San Francisco remarkable!", "domain": "tripadvisor", "id": "9ae3959a5eaa77fdb15de69a8fea209d", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "concierge", "nn_mod": "friendly", "q_reviews_id": "e7b5a094d2646afd46067b95329a1ec7", "query_asp": "concierge", "query_mod": "great", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How has the concierge service been?", "question_subj_level": 2, "review_id": "tripadvisor_review_9023", "title": "usa_san francisco_jw_marriott_san_francisco_union_square", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [59, 59], "text": ["the vanilla flavor is a little strong for my preference", "the vanilla flavor is a little strong"]}, "context": "This is good coffee - not weak, and not overly strong, but the vanilla flavor is a little strong for my preference.

Unfortunately, he was seriously injured at work almost 2 years ago. His sleep is erractic and pain makes the only place sleep is possible, is his recliner. Since I never know when he will be able to sleep, I stopped listening to the programs I had enjoyed, so it wouldn't bother him. My brother suggested I check out wireless headphones. He told me a very little bit, but mostly look for the kind that were wireless and not line of sigth, in other words the kind that could go through walls, ceilings, etc. So, I started researching and reading. I thought I would just pick up a pair at Best Buy or even Walmart. Well, the ones they both carried didn't have great write ups nor were they any cheaper than these Sennheiser RS120's from Amazon's seller Electronic Expo. Obviously, cost is important with out current situation. I'd never heard of Sennheiser. Left to buy by brand, I would have bought something familiar like Sony, but I kept reading good things about Sennheiser on every site I checked. The price was as good or better than the brands I had heard before. So I did rely heavy on the comments of others - thanks to you who posted. I am not an audiophile or techie at all.So now you know why I bought them, on to the headphones and how they work. In one word - excellent! I love, love, love them! I put them on and listen to the computer radio programs as I do housework and they don't disturb hubby from sleeping. Finally, once again I can enjoy what I want, when I want. I have only had them a month or so but I use them almost everyday from 1-2 hours, to all day long because they are compfortable enough to wear for hours, if I choose. Yeah, the ears will get a little warm but really not bad at all since they are not cupped over them. What little sound may escape doesn't bother hubby as I am not setting beside him when I use them and I doubt they would do so even then, because I don't have anything that close to my ears blasting. I have worn them out to the garage to load my truck with some things, out to the end of the house to the garbage can and even down to the end of the driveway which is about 175' long. I never lost my signal. I did get white noise louder than my signal only once and that was when I pushed the garbage can over to the side of the drive and I was underneath a powerline transmitter - duh - no surprise there was some interference there. But, obviously it only lasted a the few seconds it took to leave the garbage can there and then as I stepped away, the signal was clear again. My house is a ranch house, 65' long. The computer and headphones transmitter are literally on one end of it in the dining room we use as an office. The entire house and full length basement recieve a signal just fine. When I walk through a doorway, I occasionally get a little hiss or white noise mixed into the voices, but only passing through the doorway. The rest of the time is perfect. Performance is A+ for me.To be honest, I have not hooked them up to the TV nor Stereo, but all of the plugs you need to do so are included. I can say that on the radio talk shows I listen to they do occasionally play music coming on, going off, commercial breaks etc, and it sounds great. So, I am sure listening to CD's would only be better.If there are any negatives it would be the inability to tighten them just a little more. Thanks to reviews by others I was aware of this before purchase, however, I wasn't intending to use them for exercise so it didn't matter. It still isn't a big issue. I am only 5'2\" and have a pretty small head. Adjusted to the smallest size works well for almost every thing I do. If I am running the dust mop and bend over to pick up the cat's toy they are fine and don't move. Once I was bent over for a while as I was pulling out everything from the closet floor to clean in there and they slipped around. Not off, just off center of the ear. Had I not stopped and repositioned them, I suppose they could have fallen but it was not that big of a deal. I did find that a little of my hair had gotten between the headphones and my ear. If I make sure all my hair is pulled back before positioning the headphones on the ear they stay put better. I guess a cup style wouldn't matter but these do, so if you have long hair, make sure it is all out from between the headphones and ear.The only other thing I could say that it was lacking was better instructions. I may not be an audiophile but I figured out how to hook everything up simply by looking at it. I did learn things from posts however, I wouldn't have known otherwise. For instance, I received them, let them charge overnight and then when I tried them the sound quality was not good. There was a LOT of noise even close to the transmitter. From the review posts I had read, I was aware of the tuning button below the volume control which tuned in the signal. I didn't see anything in the packaging about that! Had I not known, I would have been dissappointed in the product. Knowing about it beforehand was great, I simply tuned in the signal and I was off to housework - happily once again.In conclusion, I cannot compare these to other wireless models, they are my first ones. But, I am VERY happy and for $59, I feel it was well worth my money.

This show chronicles the adventures of young Buffy Summers, a high school student who is revealed as the Chosen One destined to fight the demons and vampires that plague the world. Since this was a mid-season replacement, there were only 12 episodes in this 1st season. As always, Sarah Michelle Geller is at the top of her game in the title role, while Anthony Stewart Head is full of wry humor as Rupert Giles, her Watcher.The episodes, despite being filmed in 16mm, are sharp in both visual and sound quality. However, the special features are a little lacking. There's an insighful and amusing commentary by show creator, Joss Whedon, which covers the 2 part pilot for the show. However, the Whedon interview sections only covers only half of the episodes, being a hold-over from the old 3-pack VHS set. Also, the interview with David Boreanez (Angel) doesn't offer anything new. Some outtakes and making of featurettes would've been nice.

I have experienced some softness out beyond 200mm while using it on auto-focus, but I am learning to work within the limits of the lens. Given what has been said in some reviews about softness out past 200mm (and my own initial experience) I decided to run some tests for how sharp the pictures could really be. The one caveat I had is that for the tests I ran I used manual focus - I wanted to test the optics not the AF or VR functions since they are not a requirement for using the lens. Also, I am starting to get very interested in Equestrian photography. I need the long zoom and have found that pre-focusing on a point, rather than depending on Auto-focus is much more effective for obtaining the results I am looking for.For my test I used this lens mounted on a D300 to take some pictures of a bell tower. Because I was specifically testing the lens for sharpness past 200mm (I shot several at 300mm) I focused the lens manually, and used a tripod. As it turned out there was chain link fencing over the opening to the bell which I could not see, from where I was standing in a parking lot across the street. That made my test even better.I then took several shots of the bell and the tower, being careful to focus the lens on specific characteristics of the bell. The shots were all sharp. I then downloaded and examined the photos at high magnification on my PC. I did not lose any significant resolution of the chain link (which I could only make out after I downloaded the pictures) or the objects I was focused upon until I viewing the shots at 200% or greater magnification. At that point you could actually begin to see the individual pixels. So I have to say that I do not agree with the reviews about how the lens gives poor results out past 200mm. I have obtained excellent results through the entire zoom range.I will say that the AF-S system for the lens seems to hunt a lot when there are a lot of objects in the field of view (i.e., the leaves on a tree while trying to photograph a bird), so it does sometimes focus on something other that what I want - that could have been what the others were complaining about. But if I assure myself that it is focused on my target and use the AF lock built into the camera that problem goes away. Also if I use the lens on manual focus the problem goes away.I am very happy with the lens and highly recommend it.

I'll list a few pros and cons and then talk about what I think of the product overall.Pros-Easy to use, feels amazing. It uses a usb stick to do everything, although you do need to have your own charger cable as it doesn't come with one (USB to mini usb). The headset is very comfortable and has plushy padding on the ear cups and head band. I have no problem wearing these for lengthy gaming sessions (3 hours or more) or watching a couple movies in a row.-Packs a lot of sound, for it being virtual 7.1 it sounds great but not amazing. If you're used to high end headsets/headphones this might not be the thing for you, but if you're looking to save some money and still have a decent headset then you definitely want to pick this up. The stereo sounds good, but the virtual surround sound is the way to go.-Looks fantastic, this is one of the better looking headsets I've owned. It might not be for everyone, but I really like the design of this.-Absolutely wireless, this is a huge plus for me as I hate having to deal with wires.-I've talked with friends over games and over skype and they all say that the mic sounds good, but for skype I normally use my Blue Snowball USB mic anyway.Cons-Controls for sound/volume are weird. There are two control slides, one for game/movie volume and one for voice chat (in game). When I'm playing with friends and we're in an intense game, sometimes I'll need to adjust the headset so I can hear them better rather than the game volume. I've noticed that it's just easier to take off the headset entirely and change it that way that moving my hand behing my head in a somewhat awkward position. It's not a deal breaker by any means buts till annoying.-While I complimented the sound in the pros, I need to mention it in the cons as well. It's not going to blow you away, the virtual surround is good but it's still virtual. I've noticed the highs are great, the mids are awesome, but the lows are just alright.Those are the main points I wanted to make, but I also want to note that before this headset I owned a pair of Tritton AX Pros. The Tritton's were beast, had great sound and a great sounding mic. They weren't without fault though as they were really heavy on my head. Felt like a full pound or so, while this Sony headset is really light and feels great on the ears. The Tritton's also required a whole slew of wires to be attached and taken off then reattached: it was a mess. The number one reason for me getting this Sony headset is because it's wireless, the second was the amazing price. The sound is about 3.75 stars, while the price bumps it to about 4.5. I would like to give it a 4.5 star rating but Amazon doesn't allow .5 increments, and it's definitely not a 5 star headset so 4 stars will have to do.I hope this rather long review helps you in your buying process.Z", "domain": "electronics", "id": "60c4cd2bbdbbe8db4e67368919bc498a", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "stereo", "nn_mod": "good", "q_reviews_id": "9ea767060b5e85eea7a5b13ab77c83eb", "query_asp": "quality", "query_mod": "loud", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the quality?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "46d15cb06c27abdc859659f6ccaf0d95", "title": "B0053OLY9O", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "To tell you the truth, I was depressed when I first heard that Pierce Brosnan was replaced by Daniel Craig. But to my surprise, Daniel Craig is a really good James Bond who fits closely with the Ian Fleming description of Bond. Gone is the gentleman assassin associated with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan's depiction; here we have the early Sean Connery Bond, the ruthless, detached assassin-spy. Daniel Craig brings back the danger in 007; you believe that Craig could at any moment strangle you to death, put a knife into your belly, or shoot you without blinking an eye. (Timothy Dalton captures the danger in Bond really well in his 2 films \"Living Daylights\" and \"Licence to Kill\") Craig reminds me a lot of Steve McQueen and his Bond is more like Jason Bourne -- the action is fast and furious.We also see Craig as a human Bond; he makes mistakes, he is driven by his male ego, he gets bruised, he bleeds, he gets tortured, and he gets heartbroken. All this was reflected in the Bond described in the novel Casino Royale. Craig is a really good actor who helps the viewer see inside the character of the man, just as George Lazenby did in \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\". It's nice to see Bond brought back down from being a comic book hero to being a real man with real emotions and issues. Great job, Daniel Craig!Eva Green does a commendable job as Vesper Lynd, Bond's love interest. Vesper is an intelligent and capable Treasury agent every bit as equal to Bond. It's always great to have a strong woman character in a Bond movie.There were some shortcomings in this movie: The chase sequence goes on too long where Bond chases the bombmaker. The title song and sequence weren't that great. The poker game drags on a bit too long, even though they put in bits of action in between. In fact, the whole movie could have been trimmed 25 minutes. Secondly, it is weird to hear M talk about 9-11 when this is the \"Bond Begins\" film; we have to forget 40 years of Bond films as though they didn't exist. Third, even though Judi Dench is a great actress, someone much younger should have been \"M\" for the chronology to make sense. Here Judi Dench looks older than \"Die Another Day\" when this is supposed to happen way before.Fourth, we know that Q doesn't show up until Dr. No, but it would have been great to have Bond have some gadgets either in his car or in his briefcase, not just the defibrillator. Also, it would have been great to have some good car chases, and have the Aston Martin do something.However, Martin Campbell does a great job of directing and introducing the 21st century Bond, just as he did in 1995 with Pierce Brosnan.I look forward to the next segment of Craig's Bond. I'm wondering if they could remake \"Man with the Golden Gun\", \"A View to a Kill,\" and \"Moonraker\", 3 of the most forgettable in the film series.The special features in the 2 disc version are great: There are 3 featurettes: one which features how Daniel Craig got the role, another which details the incredible stunts, and the third, an updated version of \"Bondgirls are Forever\" hosted by Maryam D' Abo, the bondwoman in \"The Living Daylights.\" I enjoyed the \"Bondgirls are Forever\" featurette the most -- it featured insightful interviews with all the famous bondwomen- Ursula Andress (Dr. No), Luciana Paluzzi (villainess in Thunderball), Honor Blackman (Goldfinger), Cary Lowell (License to Kill), Halle Berry (Die Another Day), Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies), Judi Dench and Samantha Bond (all the Pierce Brosnan films), Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day), Jill St. John (Diamonds are Forever), and Maud Adams (Man with the Golden Gun, Octopussy).

This book exceeded my already high expectations. After reading Colleen's other two books, Slammed and Point of Retreat, I knew that this author had a rare and beautiful talent for writing.Her books are never easy to read, in the sense that they are never light fluffy reads. Yet, they are full of substance, life lessons, and teaching us that no matter our circumstances in life, it is important to gather strength, and courage.Hopeless, was no different. At the beginning of the story, we learn that Sky was adopted when she was five years old, and has a very close relationship with her adopted mother Karen. We also learn about her best friend and the fact that both girls like to sneak boys into their room at night which has earned them a negative reputation. When Sky is making out with a boy, or should I say when he is making out with her, she feels nothing. She becomes numb and counts the stars on the ceiling in her bedroom.Sky's life changes when she meets Dean Holder or just Holder as he goes by. He sparks intense feelings inside her. As the two get to know one another, they get extremely close and fall hard for each other. Little by little, Sky starts having nightmares, and remembering long forgotten/repressed memories from her childhood. Holder helps her unravel the mystery of her past, as well as cope with what she finds out. She in turn, teaches him about love, hope, strength, and new begininngs.What I love about Colleen Hoover's writing the most, is her ability to make a story come alive in your imagination. I could picture the characters, their voices, and events that took place with great clarity. I also love how I am able to grow such deep attachments to the characters through her writing. I don't feel like I'm reading a story. I feel like I am experiencing someone else's life through their eyes. Sky and Holder became so real to me that when I experienced the depth of their pain, I had to keep saying to myself, \"This is just a story, it's not real.\" However, the painful events made me feel so bad inside for the people that have gone through, or are currently going through, some of the events that happened to Sky and Holder.Hopeless blew me away.

While I don't share that particular belief, I found the novel both enjoyable and absorbing.The plot of this novel is nothing groundbreaking. Carl Blomkvist, a disgraced Swedish journalist, is hired by a wealthy industrialist to solve a 30-year old disappearance. In order to solve the crime, he eventually teams up with Lisbeth Sander, a young, anti-social computer hacker. Together, they eventually uncover a dark family web of secrets that may involve a serial killer.The real strength of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is the characterization. The late Stieg Larsson does a superb job of creating a set of vivid characters that achieve a level of depth and complexity that you rarely find in genre fiction. In particular, the personality and background of Lisbeth Sander is quite unique and ultimately quite compelling to read about.I also very much enjoyed the setting of this book. This novel is written by a Scandinavian author and almost entirely takes place in his native country of Sweden. As an American who knows virtually nothing about Scandinavia, I found Larsson's descriptions of the Swedish government, business practices, and societal norms to be quite fascinating.This novel, however, isn't for everyone. Larsson is a wordy and descriptive writer, and this novel meanders around quite a bit in the middle, with multiple subplots (including a rather pointless romance) that really don't really drive the story forward. Larsson also sometimes uses more detail than necessary, such as when he describes in excruciating depth how hackers can break into laptop computers.Further, the crime story ends rather prematurely, with Larson devoting his final sixty pages to resolving a subplot involving the main character's professional career that I didn't find particularly interesting. While I found this book a page turner for the most part, my patience began to wear thin in spots, especially after I was two thirds of the way through.Overall, however, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a highly enjoyable read, and I think readers of quality crime fiction will find much to enjoy.

Lucado answers 172 questions ranging from the nature of heaven to getting out of debt. Each answer is about one page long and includes Bible passages and quotes from other authors where appropriate.I loved the original format and this book is so useful that it is taking up permanent residence on my bookshelves. It's the kind of book I'll go to whenever I'm looking for advice. As I was reading it, I marked three passages to immediately read to friends filled with simple wisdom like \"We are always cleaning up our act\" and \"'Don't talk to me,' we say. 'I'm in a bad mood.' As if mood were a place to which we are assigned ('I can't call you; I'm in Bosnia') rather than an emotion we permit.\"There was an inspiring addendum in the back geared towards Christian writers and the notes and indexes in the back of the book are all useful and usable.As a Catholic there were some things that I missed (like the sacred importance of the Eucharist) and one or two answers that I disagreed with; however, overall I agreed with much more than I disagreed with and found Lucado's writing to be simple, refreshing, and personable.- I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneeze.com book review bloggers program.

Figured they were throwing stuff in a box as they went. The box they used was a commercial box it wasn't like they just threw it in a paper bag.My experience was completely opposite. They provide you with more than enough bolts. Every tv is different they cant possibly match every TV in the world. But they sure did their best they offered 3 different sizes of mounting bolts. Everything was neatly labeled in plastic bags by letter, and part name.The instructions were so simple a 3 year old could do it. As with all machined equipment best advice is if something isn't lining up DONT TRY TO FORCE IT. Just think it thru turn it like a puzzle until things line up perfect.That being said, there were a few down sides that i've also seen from other comments. The adjustment of the swivel makes no sense to me. If you adjust it then the locking pin wont line up or the screws wont line up.. something wont line up if you swivel it.Finally the safety pins are a pain in the you know what to screw in if you have a thin tv. It's so close to the wall. And i wouldn't suggest not tightening them as any upward motion to the tv you risk the thing falling down. I had to find a socket that would fit around my screw driver, attach the socket to an extension arm... just to be able to reach the screw.I'd suggest that Cheetah consider making some sort of an extension rod that can be used to help reach them. Even if it's just a solid bar with a Phillips head on the end and a nut on the other that you can attach a socket wrench to and use it to reach the screws.I'm not sure how much this would raise the cost, and i commend them on how many extra bolts and washers they provide. Those have to add up over time. just to have the extras thrown away.Another note, by the advise of my father who helped me hang the thing, an ex carpenter, we ditched the anchors since we were drilling into studs. Just drilled a pilot hole(tiny hole) and used a ratchet to screw the lag screw in. From doing minimal research on the internet(and i suggest you do the same) anchors are only needed for concrete or if you cant find the stud.Long story short, i had a pleasant experience.

The video is crisp and clear with only a small hint of edge enhancement. There are maybe 2 specks of dust/dirt on the entire 139 minute film. Simply amazing for a film this old.The audio has been enhanced for a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, can also be watched in an enhanced stereo mix or can even be watched in the original theatrical release's stereo mix. Can also be watched in French and Spanish. English subtitles are available for the hard of hearing, or the odd person who wishes to watch the movie in a foreign language they don't know. Since I'm not sure where else to include it with my review, there is also a commentary from Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews.For the Mary Poppins fan, there is a tremendous amount of bonus material. On the second disc there is a 50 minute making of, 10 minute short, several clips on how scenes were made and a round table (actually, around a piano) discussion with Dick Van Dyke, Julie Andrews and Richard Sherman. There is a game to be played for children and a lot of other material. A bonus on the first disc (the feature) is the ability to watch with fun pop-up facts that give you interesting information about certain scenes.Having been one to have never seen the movie all the way through, and having only ever sat through bits and pieces, I wasn't sure what to expect when I began watching. I was blown away. Even if a person can't appreciate the imaginative brilliance of the film, they should be able to see the technical brilliance of the special effects. Mary pulling various, larger than the bag items from her carpet bag, the near seamless integration of animation and live action and the amount of work needed to choreograph all of the dance moves. This movie puts some of the CG work done today to shame. George Lucas should take notes from this film to make his works actually worth watching.Watching this movie 40 years after it was made also drives home the fact that the Disney company has fallen a very long way. From a company about giving dreams and entertainment to children, to a company concerned only with the bottom line and the next gimmick. Walt Disney understood what the current Disney management does not, a good movie will make you money and is timeless. The amount of imagination that went into this film puts recent Disney fair to shame.I hate to admit it, but had I not received a promotional copy of this DVD, I probably never would have watched it. Having now seen it, I would have been doing myself a huge disservice not watching it. For those that feel that this isn't there type of movie, simply watch with an open mind. I went expecting to turn it off after 15 minutes, what I ended up doing was watching the entire 139 minute film and not even realizing 2 hours and 20 minutes had even passed.Highly recommended for Mary Poppins fans and film fans.

It was about the Germans attacking and trying to take over the Russian City of Stalingrad during World War II (WWII). I had no idea the German army had gotten that far into Russia before. But then again I didn't immerse myself in studying WW II either. I'm not sure just how much of the story line was based on fact but if most of it was true then I am totally amazed.The opening scenes were brutal and reminded me of the first half-hour of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. They showed the Russians coming off a train. Every other soldier in line was handed a rifle; the next person in line was handed the ammunition. They were told if the person in front of you gets killed, grab the rifle and go on yourself. As they crossed the river to attack the enemy and defend their homeland they were virtually massacred. If the Germans didn't kill them, their own officers were shooting them calling them cowards. One man, Vassily Zaitzev portrayed by Jude Law, came to the aid of another, Joseph Fiennes character Danilov. The way Vassily fired his weapon was certainly what made the story. He soon became a member of a sniper crew.Thanks to Danilov his name and face was in the papers. His superiors made a big thing out of him. The country needed a hero and he was to be it. It wasn't long before the Germans sent in their top sniper, Major Konig played by Ed Harris, to try to locate this now famous Russian. The movie then went back and forth between the two men and what they were doing.The film was suspenseful. It had action, combat scenes, intrigue, heroes, villains, and a little romance.

I would prefer if they were a little better built, but they're acceptable for the price. The fabric used on the ear pieces and the head padding is the same fabric they use in fabric lint rollers. It's soft enough, but collects lint accordingly. The mic boom is flexible rubber and decent quality, but it doesn't allow you to adjust its location in and out and sits further from the mouth than expected.Pros:Sound - The sound quality is very decent. I'm not an audiophile so take it with a grain of salt, but both games and music are quite enjoyable for me with this headset.Comfort - At first I found these uncomfortable and pinching which after an hour of use caused significant discomfort. However, once I lowered the ear pieces to wear this a bit loose (more loose than I normally prefer headphones) they fit much better. After hours of use they are still comfortable for me.Microphone - The mic is very sensitive and picks up sound really well.Cons:USB - The USB interface is one you want to avoid for headsets if you have a good soundcard. USB headsets include their own audio card built-in to the device in order to work. Therefore, using these will bypass the soundcard in your computer. Also, the USB cable is quite short. This device isn't compatible with USB 3.0. Since I only have 3.0 on the front panel of my computer I would prefer a longer cord to run it from the back.Dolby - The simulated 7.1 is not appealing to me. It simulates surround by making the audio more `spatial'. This doesn't add to the audio quality though; it makes the sound worse in my opinion. The default setting is off,Volume Control - The volume control is a rocker switch in a convenient location on the back of the left ear-piece. The rocker switch is annoying. You rotate and hold it in one direction or the other to change the volume. I would prefer a dial instead of holding a switch.No Audio Controls - This device has no equalizer to adjust the audio. The audio levels it ships with is okay, but if you wanted to customize your sound you should purchase a different headset.Microphone - The mic is overly sensitive and even on low input volumes it picks up any background noise like you mouse and keyboard, breathing, etc.In summary, decent sound and comfort for the price, but has some limitations.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "96406c29b0298769a44ccec56cce38bb", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "mic", "nn_mod": "sensitive", "q_reviews_id": "61acda92b46a099ec2e28a62d2c695a2", "query_asp": "microphone", "query_mod": "good", "ques_subj_score": 0.4000000059604645, "question": "How is the sound quality of these plantronics microphone ?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "b1f8016c33ac0d6d02a5c3a3bfd85025", "title": "B006ZS5ATM", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "HiHave been using this for almost 5 days and this protector looks great, very clear unlike the previous ZAGG one i had.

I'm game! and both versions are on one disc, I love both versions, so thats another bonus for this set.Paramount has done a great job with these Sapphire Series, I will be reviewing the Braveheart one and the Saving Private Ryan ones when I watch them, I've sampled them, and they look fantastic, but this one here is truly outstanding.Now if you buy the triple feature sapphire series set, you get all 3 movies said above, but you won't get the extras, and I'm a completist, so I bought all 3 seperatly, but still, these 3 movies on blu ray for about $25.00 for the set is still a great deal don't get me wrong, just no extras.I don't need to say much about the movie, fans of this film know truly how great of a film this is, so my focus was on the product itself, so if you are a fan of this movie, this edition is a MUST HAVE!, I'll still keep my DVDs of it of course, but this one will see the playing time!", "domain": "movies", "id": "7276853e33af2521bca9be3d89bcb5e9", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "one", "nn_mod": "good", "q_reviews_id": "c40d776815ddcef9ab0e73b776742c21", "query_asp": "action", "query_mod": "paced", "ques_subj_score": 0.10000000149011612, "question": "How can you describe the action?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "976bec24e65c162cfe01b68c7d53f1e8", "title": "B00003CXE6", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [46, 50], "text": ["The staff was top rate", "staff was top rate"]}, "context": "We had a wonderful time at the J.W.

The main character, Mikael Blomkvist, is a journalist who was hired by a rich old man to take another look at the disturbing disappearance of a family member. A second main character, Lisbeth Salander, is a computer hacker with lots of *personal* issues due to its own sad life story. Being misunderstood from young age, and exploited in later parts of her life, she has very little trust in about basically everything that society has to offer: the authorities, work colleagues, and consequently has almost no friends to relay on. However, being highly intelligent, she manages to get through life in very original ways.As expected in the genre, the books starts by jumping from Mikael story line, to Lisbeth's plot, and eventually both stories intersect and a joint story-line emerges. Two things that I've noted while reading: First, in contrast to many similar novels that usually takes several background chapters before they become interesting, this books is very engaging from the first pages. This is probably due to Lisbeth, who is a very original and interesting character. Second, the flow and pace of the book is great: it starts interesting, and half way through you simply cannot put it down as you want to see what happens next. Lisbeth's character is very interesting, and it is especially intriguing to learn her way of thinking about different issues, and her biased, yet logical view of reality.Great fun, read and enjoy. By the way, I know there is a (Hollywood) movie around the corner for the book. However, I think that in this case I recommend reading the book before watching the movie, as I'm not sure that a movie script can make a good case of presenting Lisbeth's unique thought process.", "domain": "books", "id": "37f922950c801c0f91bf6397b694ac7d", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "book", "nn_mod": "engaging", "q_reviews_id": "7cc340866fafa0f5a3472a283b349263", "query_asp": "book", "query_mod": "enthralling", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the story in the book?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "591c8a7151802856828bf2bbcf98ece2", "title": "0143170090", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "This series is full of new takes on old stories.

In his own words, \"I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy\".The plot is quite simple, mainly what happens when a particularly sensitive teenager gets kicked out of school, and decides to travel alone a little bit instead of just telling his parents what happened. However, even if the main premise is common enough, the way it is delivered is what makes this book so special that it has become a classic. Salinger makes us get to know Holden, giving the reader interesting insights into his musings, likes and dislikes (yeah, generally mostly dislikes).You want some examples?. For instance, and regarding teachers, he says that \"You can't stop a teacher when they want to do something. They just do it\". Or when he starts to think about the things we say over and over again, without giving them any actual meaning: \"I'm always saying `Glad to `ve met you` to somebody I'm not at all glad I met. If you want to stay alive, you have to say that stuff, though\".Holden's views are interesting, and different readers will interpret them in diverse ways, specially if their age isn't the same. To teenagers, Holden reflects the highs and lows they have to deal with, and their struggle with the \"phony world\" of adults that sometimes seems so weird, so wrong. To adults, Holden is a part of themselves that they somehow lost with the years, the innocence and the shock before things they have grown accustomed to with time.There are quite a few symbols in this book, but you will able to understand it even if you don't know a thing about symbology (or aren't interested in it). Despite that, I'd like to share with you a specially important symbol, the catcher in the rye that gives this book its title. Holden wants to be the catcher in the rye when he grows up: \"Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff--I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going. I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.\" . He doesn't know why, he just wants to come out from somewhere and catch little children before they fall from the cliff. In a way, that shows how much he wants to preserve their innocence, against a phony world that tries to corrupt them...I really liked this book, and I found it engaging and very easy to read. I'm not from USA, so I didn't have to read it as obligatory reading material for school, but I ended up reading it all the same mainly out of curiosity because many of my American friends recommended it to me. After reading \"The catcher in the rye\", I must say that they were right, and I would like to recommend this book to you, if you haven't read it yet. And if you are forced to read it for school, please JUST GIVE IT AN OPPORTUNITY. I know it is hateful having to read something merely because someone says so, but in this case that will work to your advantage... What can I say?.

So, when I set out to review Chewy Gooey Chocofudge, my expectations were not high, but I didn't expect them to taste THAT bad.In order to give a fair and balanced review, I sought help from two others: My mom and my teenage daughter. Mom and I were on the same page, not good. Certainly not horrible, but just not good. We are both experienced cookie bakers and both know that its very difficult for mass produced cookies to match up with home baked. We did take this into consideration.Number one: The cookies were somewhat soft, but they also crumbled when taking bites; \"chewy\" cookies are not suppose to do that. They were hardly \"gooey\". There is a bit fudge in the center, but gooey means that it pulls like hot cheese on a pizza. So, Nabisco, don't claim gooey if they're not! Finally, once swallowed, both my mom and I experienced an unpleasant and lingering aftertaste. Yucky to say the least.My daughter, though, thought they were wonderful!

Quite disappointing.On the back cover, it's called an 'Erotic Romance'. That it is...well, that is, up until the end. Excuse me, Miss James, but your ending sucked!The story begins with Anastasia Steele going to the business office of a very young, handsome billionaire to interview him for the school newspaper. She's only doing this because her friend, Kate, is ill. When she meets Christian Grey, she is mesmerized by his looks, his demeanor and his power.Christian is very over-powering to Ana, and she feels compelled to do whatever he wants. He is a Dominent. He wants her to be his Submissive. He gives her a contract to look over and sign, if she so wishes. She is unsure about signing the contract, as she has her own \"rules\" she wishes him to abide by as well.He 'gives' into her want of something more than just sex, because he starts having feelings for her. He realizes that she is as mesmerizing and as amazing to him as he is to her. But, the secrets he holds bother Ana. He has difficulty opening up to her, to tell him why he needs to cause her pain, and she feels the need to know everything about him.He lavishes gifts on her that are unwanted, and sexually, they have an amazing relationship. But, Ana wants more...she wants him to cuddle her, to sleep with her in the same bed instead of leaving her after he has had his way with her. When she gives him what he wants, allowing him to restrain her, and to use his many \"toys\" on her, he starts giving in and giving her the more that she wants.When his secrets are revealed at the end, Ana understands that she can never be what he wants her to be, to do the things that he wants to do to her, so she leaves.I can't reveal what his secrets are. You'll have to read the book for that. However, I will say that if you do not like erotic books, then don't read this. If you don't like bondage, restraining, anything involving pain (regardless of whether it's used in a sexual way or to \"punish\" someone), then don't get this book.I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I started reading this book...and while I've read my fair share of erotic stories/books, this one actually had some substance to it.Ok, so the book wasn't bad...it was the ending that sucked. How can this book be called a romance when the romance died emotionally, physically and everything inbetween, at the end? With just a few pages to go, I thought Christian and Ana were going to declare their love for one another, that she had broken him of some of his wanting to 'hurt' her. By the last page, I wanted to dump the novel in the trash. It sucked. I'm truly pissed off about it because I wanted the proverbial happy ending. Does that make it a good book because I'm pissed off? Not in my books.I have another reason for hating this book...the author must have gotten a new thesaurus for Christmas because there were so many words in the book that I had to look up in the dictionary. One or two words I found in the book, weren't even in the dictionary.So, disappointment has found me because I really thought that I was going to love this book. I'm giving this book 2 stars. This book lost one star for being so hyped up that I wanted to buy it, one star for the lousy ending, and the third star for me having to spend so much time looking up stupid words like phelgmatically, which isn't even a word according to the dictionary.This book sucks.

On the other hand, I am also picky about sound quality and am able to immediately notice many aspects of speaker design based on how they affect the sound of a song.With that said, my appraisal of the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 system is a 5-star rating. These high-quality speakers are excellently designed, admirably built, and deliver outstanding sound quality whether they are used with music, movies, or video games.First off, the speakers themselves are wonderful. Featuring strong midrange drivers and bright \"horn style\" tweeters (a Klipsch tradition), they deliver the full range of frequencies contained in a typical audio track. In this regard they surpass competition such as Logitech, which lacks good midrange abilities. The Klipsch speakers are good enough to draw out flaws in lower quality audio tracks, which can be mildly annoying, but is a great testimony to the quality of the drivers and filters.Now, the subwoofer. I demand GOOD bass from my music. I hate deafeningly loud, boomy bass units that obscure the higher frequencies and irritate everyone within a half mile radius. On the other hand, weak bass drivers that rattle and vibrate or distort when the music is turned up are also an abomination. The Klipsch subwoofer, which runs at 50 watts continuously and can peak at 130 watts, is perfect for in-home audio use. While it probably would not be sufficient to overcome road noise in a car (I have a 150 watt subwoofer there), it is more than ample for a home theater system. I absolutely love the sound of the bass from this thing; while it is ported, which generally makes for boomier bass, the Klipsch unit does deliver very tight, clean bass. A former roommate who was arguably much more of an \"audiophile\" than myself even commented with approving surprise about the great resonance the sub has at low frequencies. Again, this sub might appear to be weak at only 50 watts RMS, but it is MORE than sufficient. If you turn up the volume loud enough to start distorting or rattling the subwoofer, you will be completely deafened by the satellites.Features are where the Klipsch speakers lose a few points from the overall rating...but not very many. Like most computer speakers, they feature a decently lengthy input cord (1/8\" [3.5mm] stereo mini-jack), headphone port, and volume adjustment on the primary satellite.In addition, three features stand out as especially nice. First, there is an additional input port (female 1/8\" [3.5mm] stereo mini-jack) which means you can play music and video games at the same time, for example.Next, the speakers are connected to the amplifier/subwoofer unit via detachable 2-wire speaker cords, NOT hardwired cords. This means you have a lot of flexibility in the placement of the units; additionally, the included wires are very long. If they aren't long enough, you could also solder an extra length of ordinary speaker wire to the amplifier end because they simply clip into place. The satellite ends have 1/8\" jacks on them which plug firmly into the back of the satellites.Lastly, the subwoofer can be fully adjusted via a knob on the primary satellite, meaning you can turn it down or even off without affecting the volume of the music. This is great in apartments and dorms where the bass is OK during the day but must be toned down at night to avoid disturbing people.The one feature of the set that is NOT a plus would be the placement of the power switch. In order to prevent that awful popping noise that occurs when you power up a speaker set remotely (such as by flipping the switch on a power strip), you'll want to use the unit's built-in power switch. Unfortunately, this is located on the back lower part of the amplifier/subwoofer, under the wiring connections and generally in a place where you will have trouble reaching. Usually, the sub gets tucked away under a desk or in a corner, and thus the switch location is rather terrible. Logitech systems, for example, often have a remote or hardwired control pod which includes power and volume controls.Build quality on the speakers is also a plus. The subwoofer is sturdy and rugged MDF, with a quality black coating and a firmly attached rear amplifier panel. The satellites are injection molded plastic, but it is thick and strong, and the bases (which can be removed for optional wall mounting) are coated metal. I have had the speakers for several years now and they have never once acted up on me or required repair.All in all, the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 set is a phenomenal, spectacular set of speakers for a relatively cheap, 2.1 style unit that was designed with computer audio in mind. With a few adapters, you can easily use this with your TV, XBox, and many other devices, as I currently do. Again, larger home audio units will provide better and louder sound, but these will also cost a great deal more. I would highly recommend these speakers to anyone who needs a compact setup but demands good quality sound.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "2c2c07972f774330a7cd88214fa8edc1", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "speaker", "nn_mod": "wonderful", "q_reviews_id": "76fc853db516808cabe9fa2d8a579f19", "query_asp": "speaker", "query_mod": "clear", "ques_subj_score": 0.38333332538604736, "question": "How is the speaker clear?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "2f05da2ec23c59dfa4c25f5a12819198", "title": "B000062VUO", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "The book was enjoyable and fast paced.

We got to sit by the window, which is the perfect spot for people-watching while enjoying a relaxing meal. The restaurant has a laid-back, hipster vibe in the decor, as well as the service. We ordered two starters, two tacos, and two paletas. The presentation of each and every dish was lovely.Green Apple Scallop Ceviche served with fried plaintains (one of the specials of the day) -- it was a mixture of scallops, cilantro, chopped green apples and red peppers over guacamole, and topped with pumpkin seeds. The tanginess from the green apple bits was an interesting addition to this dish, but I felt the cilantro was quite overpowering (I am biased though because I do not like cilantro, parsley, celery, and the like). Mexican Street Corn -- a messy eat, but it was the BEST corn-on-the-cob I've ever had. I have tried spreading butter and sprinkling chilli powder on a grilled corn-on-the-cob, but sour cream, chilli powder AND cheese? Sweet, creamy, spicy, AND cheesy? Mmm...it was very tasty!Beef Cheek Taco -- La Carnita's tacos are small (like everywhere else), but this was a very packed taco. Nothing in the taco really stood out though, other than the pickled jalape\u00f1o slices. Tostada de Ceviche with Albacore Tuna -- mmm...fried tacos are always good when they are light and crispy. It was covered in chopped fish, veggies, and guacamole. I think this is now one of my favourite tacos because I love ceviche and I love guacamole.Key Lime Pie Paleta -- this was full of lime flavour, so it was very tangy. The added coating of crushed graham crackers was nice though.Strawberry Shortcake Paleta -- the individual who thought of putting cake inside a popsicle is a genius! I enjoyed every bite, especially the ones filled with vanilla cake. It is one of the most interesting popsicles out there... (Apparently, a shop named Sweet Jesus -- affiliated with La Carnita, I believe -- will be offering these delicious paletas and it will soon open at John & Adelaide.)I would definitely come back to La Carnita for the corn, the fried taco, and the paletas.

Sky has also never gone to public school (or any school) before, but she's enrolling for her Senior year in order to list some extracurricular activities on her college applications. Upon attending school, she signs up for none, unless you count being stalked by Dean Holder as an extracurricular activity. At nearly 18 years old, Holder is the first guy Sky has EVER been attracted to, despite making out with many. Too bad that he makes her feel uncomfortable because he's a stalker and all. At least for two days. Then things get crazy.The first 60ish% of Hopeless is 1&#9733; material. I hated absolutely everything about it. The first thing Sky tells us is that she's not a slut unless being slutty means making out with lots of guys. Um, well, that's not what being a slut means, so no you're not a slut. I actually think it's great that she's comfortable enough to do what she wants with guys and stop them when it starts crossing into territory she doesn't want to go. What I'm not okay with is all of the &#34;slut this&#34; and &#34;whore that&#34; and &#34;I don't have sex so I'm not a slut&#34; and blah, blah, blah! This all spans several chapters. Sky really wants us to know she is not a slut, since she's never even been attracted to a boy before, and only makes out because it lets her shut her brain off and not feel anything. Of course, on her first day of school she's already the school slut, but she holds her head high. Wonderful.Then she meets the one boy who gives her butterflies and makes her want to do naughty, naughty, dirty things. Meet Holder! He follows Sky to her car after glaring at her, demands to know her name, snatches her ID, and clearly has anger problems. Sky thinks he's sexy as hell, but she's also nervous because of his &#34;intense&#34; behavior. Holder proceeds to stalk her for the next two days, and actually gets pissed off when she points out that she doesn't know him, because ya know...she doesn't. Then later on, he gets pissed off again about a bracelet she's wearing, grabs her, yells at her, then disappears for a whole month. Sky's reaction? She wants an apology so she can give him a second chance. By the way, she thought he was just on drugs. How about NO!Does Holder apologize? Nope. He climbs through her window in the middle of the night, climbs into bed with her, and they start making out. I don't know about you, but I'd scream my head off if someone just appeared in my bed with their lips all over me! Then he cooks her breakfast, because nothing says I'm sorry like fresh bacon. He gives this epic speech about how he won't apologize because he doesn't want forgiveness. I don't really think it's up to him whether or not Sky forgives him (which she does), but let's just play along. Now they're in &#34;live.&#34; That's somewhere between like and love, if you were wondering.Let's talk about Holder a bit more. Clearly he's unstable. He literally stalks Sky and shows abusive tendencies. Sky even points out all of the red flags, but she clearly doesn't care, because...he has a tragic past that totally explains his behavior! Okay, so, his story does make it clear why he is the way he is, but it in no way excuses his actions. He admits to nearly beating a kid to death like it's no big deal. Aside from grabbing Sky's arm over the bracelet, later when all of the craziness of Hopeless comes out, he shoves her aside hard enough that she falls! I understand why he did it, but again, not an excuse! I can't say why because it's a huge spoiler. Anyone who is capable of this is not boyfriend material! Does Sky think any of this is wrong? Nope, they just have lots of sex to forget about it!Now, I did really like the plot once it showed up. However, it had already been tainted by everything I already mentioned. Hopeless really felt like two distinct books, and it's certainly long enough that it could have been. That first 60% is all about this unhealthy relationship and there are some hints about what's to come. The last 40% was actually quite good. I flew through it because I had to know what the heck was going on. I did figure out the situation with Sky's father as soon as he was mentioned, so it was just a matter of waiting another 300 pages for everyone else to realize it to. This made it not as shocking when it came out, which is unfortunate, because this could have been really emotional.While I liked the last part of Hopeless a lot, it did feel like the author had a checklist of issues and included all of them. There's adoption, sexuality, suicide, grief, repressed memories, child abuse, incest, kidnapping, mistaken identities, and probably some others that I'm forgetting. There's even a token gay friend. I actually did like Breckin, but I was annoyed that he was only the token gay friend. Once the plot appeared, it was twist after twist after twist. When you thought the worst has appeared, more comes!Hopeless is...I don't even know. The relationship between Sky and Holder was the biggest downfall. I think all of the intense plot twists were suppose to distract us from his previous actions, and probably excuse it, but it doesn't. This is not a healthy relationship. He has issues that he needs to get under control before he seriously hurts someone else. Sky has her own issues so that she apparently looks past his abuse, since she needs him to heal her, because sex heals all! And is this being pushed as New Adult? It's not. It is literally sexed up YA. The characters are 17 and in high school. There's just a lot of sex and violence, making it mature YA not NA.", "domain": "books", "id": "177d36d30623c89e39699730213d63d6", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "thing", "nn_mod": "crazy", "q_reviews_id": "423b8c3736b8f3735b4a8e473f2f2933", "query_asp": "plot", "query_mod": "awesome", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How was the plot?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "6897ce2ef52b1bc36554a532ec07a226", "title": "147674355X", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "3.5/5! *This review is only for Summerlicious dinner - $35. *Imo lunch menu is better since they have the legendary pancake.

The restaurant feels elegant but not stuffy nor pretentious.-House Cured Trout: The cured trout was really tasty, I liked how the saltiness of the lump fish roe and sweetness of the melon really complimented one another. The soft whipped cream cheese, refreshing cucumber and slightly bitter (and aromatic) dill really enhanced the flavor of the cured trout when eaten in one bite!-Soup of Sweet Corn: The sweet corn soup is a little bit thin for my liking, as I'm used to the Asian style of a thick and silky soup texture. With that said, because of the thin texture, the soup wasn't too filling and perfect as an appetizer! The flavors of the soup was amazing. It was not too sweet as the lime balanced out the sweetness of the corn and coconut milk, and the chili lent a subtile hint of spice. -Coffee Smoked Baby Back Ribs: It wasn't my favourite. Normally I don't like coffee in the marinade as it accentuates the bitter and smoky flavors of the rib. However I'm glad the coffee wasn't too strong so I was still able to enjoy the meat itself and other ingredients.I never fully appreciated grits, until I tasted the aged cheddar grits at Mildred's Temple Kitchen, which was the most incredible grits I have ever had.

Depending on which programs you will use with it, you just go onto your computer and enter a code and everything is set up.That being said, while I still truly love this player, I have a couple of issues with it.1) I am always afraid that I will lose the remote. It is so small.2) The remote is erratically responsive or unresponsive. It seems like you have to get it at the exact angle for it to work correctly. This can be annoying.3) It got unplugged one day, and my amazon.com video library did not show up anymore. I'm not sure if this was an amazon.com issue or a roku issue, but I had to uninstall the amazon on demand program and then re-set it up.4) The quality is not always what I would expect HD to be even though I have it plugged in with a gold HDMI cable. Sometimes, there is a lot of pixelation, and I have a top-of-the-line LCD tv.Despite these small issues, you can't beat convenience. I used to plug my laptop into the TV, and this ROKU makes it so much easier. I don't have to plug in speakers or make sure the laptop is charged or set the screen on my laptop or the myriad of other issues I had before.If you are someone who can overlook the small stuff and enjoy the convenience, this is a great player.****UPDATE!**** 9/18/10I think I may have had a bad unit the first time around. The remote became really hard to handle on the first unit; I had to hold it one inch away and press the button repeatedly, even after replacing the batteries, in order to get it to work. I returned the first unit for another one, and this one is perfect. I have been using it for a week now, and there are NO issues.*****Another Update!****11/5/10Apparently, all Rokus are bad because it has been two months now, and again, my remote is not working. Thinking it was a fluke, I purchased a Logitech Harmony and programmed it with my Roku. It worked for a couple of days, and then the same thing, it stopped connecting with the Roku box.

As well the ability of Niffenegger's prose deserves praise as to capture the reader and make them empathize with the story. She could really make me live the story of Clare and Henry, but especially that of Henry, much more interesting than his wife.Bad, though, for the unnecessarily downhill final part, characterized by a continuous basking in the pain of the male protagonist. I found it sadistic towards the character itself and the readers. From the moment I knew how it would end, around page 300 (but I had a suspicion long before), I almost had no reason to go on. I continued to hope for a twist, because it seemed absurd that in a novel like that the ending would be so obvious so far in advance. But I was disappointed. The last scene is really disturbing. I read in an interview that Niffenegger has written that scene at very first, which is even more disappointing.What can I say? It certainly enriched me in many aspects of the way in which it was written, but I do not know if it was worth reading, given the prolonged bad mood that got me in the end.

As the New Yorker said (roughly), it's sounds good when described, but it does not work well, a lot of funny ideas wasted. Kevin Spacey steals every scene he is in, but he's just being the same mean guy he often is. I've now come to realize why Jason Bateman did not make it after Teen Wolf 2: he only has one character in him and he does it in every movie. Poor guy has not made a great movie yet. He works as the central character in Arrested Development because of the enormous talent surrounding him and the great writing. The guy from IASIP is just annoying. Anniston's character does not exist in real life, she is purely wish fulfillment. The three central men are portrayed as smart guys and then we are supposed to believe that all three of them will mess up their caper at every chance. They do nothing right, very predictably. Colin Farrell is fun, but only because it's him, like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder. Steve Buscemi would have been better in both roles, but we would have just believed him and not thought it funny to have a Hollywood heart-throb play a douchebag. Is it funny to see a \"stud\" play a prick with a comb-over? Maybe for the first five seconds. The best moments are played by Jamie Foxx, as well as the way too short appearance by the guy from the Fantastic Four.

I saw the hype on every blog imaginable. My Goodreads feed was bogged down with hundreds of emotional status updates. And nine out of ten reviews were five stars. But I still put off reading it until my co-blogger read it and loved it and told me I MUST read it. So I did. And I loved it. Now, the problem I'm having is writing a review that will do this book justice. I'm feeling defeated by this task. How do you write a review for a book that leaves you feeling dizzy with awe, breathless, speechless, gasping for air? So instead of writing a full review, I give you my...Top Five reasons why I fell hopelessly in love with Hopeless:1. Two words: Dean Holder.\"Dean Holder? Messy brown hair? Smoldering blue eyes? A temper straight out of Fight Club?\"Holder, with his Hopeless tattoo on his arm, is the kind of bad boy that you will fall hopelessly in love with. I fell hard for him. He's passionate, complicated, confident, fiercely protective, and witty. He has lickable dimples and a coma-inducing hot body. And every time he walked on to the pages, he gave me butterflies. And last, but certainly not least, he cuddles. Yep, Holder is book boyfriend worthy.\"When I touch you, I'm touching you because I want to make you happy. When I kiss you, I'm kissing you because you have the most incredible mouth I've ever seen and you know I can't not kiss it. And when I make love to you--I'm doing exactly that. I'm making love to you because I'm in love with you.\" - Holder2. Sky Davis, our heroine, is a wonderful, smart, saucy, technologically challenged, snarky, broken but strong, brave, book lover, kind of weird in a cool way, beautiful inside and out, and I would love to have been friends with her in high school. Sky has never felt much, or anything, with a boy the way that Holder makes her feel. Up until they meet, any other boy has made her feel numb. And Holder made her feel everything...especially lust. Lust is a whole new feeling to Sky and she didn't know what to do with it at first. It was awkward for her. And her confusion over her new feelings was endearing and funny at the same time.\"I've never been swept off my feet. I don't get butterflies. In fact the whole idea of being swooned by anyone is foreign to me... Somehow, in the course of sixty seconds, this guy has managed to swoon me, then terrify the hell out of me.\" - Sky3. The passion and fire between these two is so incredibly real and intense. The way they felt towards one another is beautiful. Almost magical. And holy sexual tension... these two have the best non-kiss ever. I think I held my breath the entire time they non-kissed. Holder is one sexy mofo with his teasing kisses on Sky's neck, cheek, eyebrow, shoulder...everywhere but the lips. That scene melted my butter.\"Sky, I'm not kissing you tonight but believe me when I tell you, I've never wanted to kiss a girl more. So stop thinking I'm not attracted to you because you have no idea just how much I am. You can hold my hand, you can run your fingers through my hair, you can straddle me while I feed you spaghetti, but you are not getting kissed tonight. And probably not tomorrow, either. I need this. I need to know for sure that you're feeling every single thing that I'm feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.\" - Holder4. The secondary characters. Six is Sky's first best friend in the whole wide world and she is absolutely the coolest chick. She walks to the beat of her drum. I love her blas&eacute; attitude. I love her uplifting texts to Sky. I love how she loves Sky. I love how Sky and Six are so different but also so much alike. And they simply accept each other for who they are. This is a true girl-mance at its best.\"Sky, you are beautiful. You are possibly the most exquisite creature in the universe and if anyone tells you otherwise, I'll cut a bitch.\" (Text message from Six to Sky)\"Only one day at public school and the bitches already made your locker rain?\" she laughs. \"Impressive.\" - SixAnd then there is the sassy, bold, and funny Breckin. On Sky's first day of school, he befriends her right away and becomes her second best friend in the whole wide world. He's gay, Mormon, and proud. Breckin rocks.\"Breckin shrugs. \"I'm new here. And if you haven't deducted from my impeccable fashion sense, I think it's safe to say that I'm...\" he leans forward and cups his hand to his mouth in secrecy. \"Mormon,\" he whispers.\" - Breckin5. The writing is amazing. Miz Hoover knows how to write an emotionally-charged story that made me feel every single word deep inside my soul. My mind went through a smattering of emotions that range from smiling and laughing (a lot!), lust, falling in love with the characters, sadness, shock, worry, nervousness, disgust, grief, acceptance, and contentment. The writing is flawless. It flows from word to word smoothly, keeping me enthralled from the beginning to the very last page. Miz Hoover writes my kind of snarky and snappy humor. I laughed out loud on several occasions. The humor adds charm and lightness to a story that could've potentially been overly dark. And the characters are so vividly real, I felt like I was living their life. Oh, and the twist. When we learn about the twist about halfway through the book, my jaw fell on the ground. It was completely unpredictable.In case you haven't noticed by now, I loved this brilliantly told story. If you are one of the few people left, who love new adult romances, and hasn't read Hopeless, read the freaking book now! I can guarantee you are missing out.With that said, I will leave you with one of my most favorite scenes. Sky is my kind of gal. I love the way she thinks...\"My locker seems to have become the hub for sticky notes and nasty letters, none of which I ever see actually being placed on or in my locker. I really don't get what people gain out of doing things like this if they don't even own up to it.Like the note that was stuck to my locker this morning. All it said was, \"Whore.\"Really? Where's the creativity in that? They couldn't back it up with an interesting story? Maybe a few details of my indiscretion? If I have to read this s*** every day, the least they could do is make it interesting. If I was going to stoop so low as to leave an unfounded note on someone's locker, I'd at least have the courtesy of entertaining whoever reads it in the process. I'd write something interesting like, \"I saw you in bed with my boyfriend last night. I really don't appreciate you getting massage oil on my cucumbers. Whore.\"I laugh and it feels odd, laughing out loud at my own thoughts. I look around and no one is left in the hallway but me.Rather than rip the sticky notes off of my locker like I probably should, I take out my pen and make them a little more creative.

I am still fairly new to coconut oil but I have been experimenting with it a lot in recent months and have found it to be my new favorite oil to cook with. I have used it to fry things in a skillet like ham. I wondered if it would taste weird but it didn't at all and I actually preferred the taste to using vegetable or canola oil. I have also used it in deserts and that is what I prefer to use it for. I have used it to make homemade fudge and it turned out really good. Yesterday I used it to make chocolate chip cookies and they were some of the most amazing cookies that I have ever had. Coconut Oil can also be used as a beauty product. If you take a little bit of it and rub it into your skin it moisturizes and makes your skin very smooth. My hands always dry out and crack as the weather turns colder out. A little bit of this coconut oil makes them feel like new again and it smells great too.This is only the second type of coconut oil that I have tried but it seems perfect quality to me. It also has a long shelf life of about 1 1/2 years according to the expiration date on the top of the container.

It seems Jackson feels the need to make every movie as long as possible, and the film really suffers because of this. Even with the strange casting, the film still could have been great. The length is what really knocks it down a level. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a 3 hour long movie as much as anyone else, but the extra length was pointless. It didn't add anything to the movie.As I said before, it's worth a watch for the special effects. Just don't go in expecting an amazing film.Rating: 2 1/2 StarsThank you for your time.", "domain": "movies", "id": "10516f8c23185d4973aa032bd1e3d565", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "film", "nn_mod": "stunning", "q_reviews_id": "c43d2a13c9e2471475ced8bc44e59363", "query_asp": "scene", "query_mod": "stunning", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the scene?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "8e625d5dc391fccc5819c55857682e36", "title": "B00005JO20", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "Summary:The book is told in the POV of both characters, so I guess I should tell the summary based by both characters.Echo:Echo was miss popularity, until she woke up in the hospital with scars all over her arms. When she heads back to school, no one wants to know her. They all believe that she was a cutter. Her father is in love with her old babysitter and the two of them are having a baby. There is a lot of change going on in her life right now and she really needs some support. Her counselor works with her to regain her memory and move forward. Inadvertently, her counselor also introduces her to Noah.Noah:Noah is Mr. bad boy. He is kind of a jerk, but he has good reasons for his attitude. He's a stoner with a heart of gold. Regardless, he is the bad boy throughout the entire book.The two meet as they are both about to partake in a B&E; to grab their files. It's not a love at first sight sort of thing, but slowly their relationship develops. Noah is not afraid of Echo's scars which is a comfort to her. She provides some strength for him. All together they make an ADORABLE (going to hug the book tight now) couple.My thoughts:Honestly, I didn't think this was going to be as tough of a book to read subject wise. I thought it would be another cute teen romance novel. It's not. The characters are gritty with so many troubles to work through. McGarry is the real gem.

That said, I'll start my review. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it to be very entertaining. However, I did not like the author's portrayal of Anne. Mary seems to be the perfect character with no flaws while Anne is made out to be a terrible sister. It shouldn't have been that black and white, since life has no black and white. I also didn't like the fact that the author used the idea that Anne resorted to incest in order to get a child. This fact made Anne actually guilty of the crimes she was accused of. The author did not need to do that. The fact that Anne had a fake trial is so much more fascinating and mouth dropping, it really doesn't need any more drama. The Tudor period is so full of it, I found this just to be put in for shock value. From all of the books I've read by Gregory, I think that Gregory has a low opinion of both Anne and her daughter Elizabeth, so I'm not surprised she made Anne out to be such a vicious woman. However, she has no compassion for Anne at all and I found I was frustrated towards the end that she tried to put as much drama and shock value as she could into the novel. That said, if you're interested in an entertaining read, I would recommend this novel. Despite the fact that I disagreed with her view of Anne did not keep me from enjoying the book.

The slow beginning confirmed my suspicions that such high expectations could not possibly be realistic, and I prepared myself to be gloriously disappointed. Quite honestly, by the end of the first chapter I shared the opinion of the protagonist, the hobbit: I was rather unenthusiastic, and doubtful that the &quot;adventure&quot; which lay ahead could truly be as exciting as it promised to be.But Tolkien rarely disappoints. Within pages, along with our hobbit hero, Bilbo Baggins, I found myself launched into the famous fantasy world that is the product of Tolkien's imagination, a world of never-ending adventure, mystery and magic. As I joined the hobbit on his remarkable quest to defeat the dragon Smaug and reconquer the dwarves long-lost treasure, I met a wonderful array of friends and foes - wizards, dwarves, elves, trolls, goblins, and a myriad of other fantastic creatures - and my imagination and interest never waned.By the end of the hobbit's adventure, like Bilbo, I was thoroughly satisfied. At the conclusion, the wizard Gandalf remarks to the hobbit: &quot;My dear Bilbo! Something is the matter with you! You are not the hobbit that you were.&quot; Yet it was not only the hobbit that had changed as a result of this adventure. As a reader, I had to confess that I too had changed. My initial lack of enthusiasm had entirely vanished. I had participated in the hobbit's adventures, and like him, returned the better for it. Tolkien's imaginative world is a world so vivid, that you cannot fail to return to the real world a changed person. His descriptive abilities cannot fail to imprint his imaginary world in your memory. This story is not deep, but it is delightful and unforgettable. And like the hobbit, you will return to life the better having read it.What's more, you can go &quot;there and back again&quot; again, and again, because the joy of this fantastic adventure won't quickly wear off.

(Isn't that always the case?) Red Queen, the computer that runs the complex, has gone mad, killing everyone in the place, and initiating a complete lock-down of the facility. The only people on the outside who might know what is going on have no memory. A crack military team is sent in to determine what happened. But things go horribly wrong...As zombie movies go, RESIDENT EVIL is pretty fun. It launches the viewer on a wild ride, rarely pausing for breath. The special effects are pretty well done, and as stated earlier, there are some pretty original decapitations using lasers. The plot is pretty loose and full of holes, but I really didn't care; I was having too much fun. The acting is typical for a monster flick, but then again, you don't watch a monster movie for the acting.If you enjoy this sort of thing, you will really like RESIDENT EVIL. My husband and I did, and it was just the thing for Halloween. But seriously, couldn't the Umbrella Corporation, who owns the research facility, see this coming? I mean, they named their master computer Red Queen. It was in the cards. Eventually, the Red Queen was obviously going to say \"Off with their heads!\"", "domain": "movies", "id": "67b367638d8a85734124266e57e87e7d", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "act", "nn_mod": "typical", "q_reviews_id": "c091d35dedc1ff1353bb1eec33725988", "query_asp": "production value", "query_mod": "low", "ques_subj_score": 0.5, "question": "How many production value this have?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "420296c0dac1f0e83d94d100fc353fea", "title": "B00005JL3A", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "UPDATE - 6/27/11 -I did get a software update a while back for the A500, and it did fix the screen waking up, this made it so that the battery will now last for a couple of days of light use before it runs out, compared to being plugged in everyday like it was before when the screen would wake up for notifications.I haven't really noticed any other large changes from the previous version. On the other hand, I did see that a leaked version of the 3.1 upgrade is out on the web today, so we should be getting that upgrade soon, and it sounds like a lot of enhancements are in that update.One other thing of note, is that I picked up a wireless usb keyboard for use with the A500, and it worked fine for me, but my wife was trying to use it with blogger and she said she was having problems with it. Seems like it couldn't quite keep up with her typing. It doesn't seem to be the keyboard but the A500 that was the limiting factor, because I used the keyboard on a normal laptop, and didn't notice any lag.I still really like using the A500 over having to use a normal laptop like I was before, it is just so much nicer that it is always on and I can just hit the power button and go! Still very happy with this purchase.END UPDATE**********************I bought this the week it showed up in a brick and mortar store near me. I love having a tablet around, it is much quick to just pick it up and use it instead of having to wake up/start up my computer. I use this for most of my web browsing now when I am at home, and I also take the tablet to work and use it for music via bluetooth (works perfectly with my sony DR-BT50 headphones).HDMII have also purchased an hdmi cable for the tablet and that works awesome. When you plug in the hdmi cable, it will automatically start mirroring the display, and the sound worked through the TV speakers as expected. I have noticed that since the resolution on the A500 is 1280x800 it cuts off part of the top and bottom when it is connected to my tv, which runs it at 720p (1280x720). This is a minor annoyance because I was able to share videos and other content quickly and easily with the tablet, where as with my laptop, it never seems to work as nice.Sound & DisplayThe sound on the tablet is really good, I was kind of surprised, for such a small thing to have such good sound. I am not saying I would want to listen to my music over the speakers, my headphones are much better for that, but for sharing music or videos with people around it works pretty well. The display is fine, good, but not great. I think the colors and brightness are fine, but my phone seems better (Galaxy S phone). The viewing angle is good, and easily sharable with a person sitting next to you.Apps & SoftwareI really like Honeycomb (Android 3), the G-mail client is much better. The browser is fine, but it is a little on the sluggish side. I planned on using this to replace a laptop for surfing the web while moving around the house, and it is good for that, but I can tell that the browser is just not as fast as the laptop on the same network, so I think it might be a little underpowered by comparison. Most sites load with the full site and not a mobile site (wired for some reason always gives me the mobile... grrrr), and that makes it a much better experience. The on-screen keyboard is ok, I am so used to using swype on my phone, that I miss it when using the A500, but I haven't tried to install it yet. As for the other apps in the android market, I have loaded a bunch of the non-tablet apps, and they seem to work fine for me. Most of them scale great (including angry birds, which is huge on a 10.1\" screen). I have also picked up a few tablet only versions, and they worked just as well.HardwareOverall the tablet seems zippy, I haven't noticed any slowdowns when running regularly, though I did get choppy video when trying to use a 720p video on You Tube while connected to HDMI. I haven't tried that again, but I have a feeling it just was too much for the tablet. Anyway I love that it has the HDMI port, and the USB micro in for transferring data over, and a normal usb for a keyboard, or flash drives.WIFIThe wifi works just ok, the signal strength doesn't seem as good as a normal laptop, but it is about the same or possibly a little better than my Galaxy S phone. I have also had times where sitting 10 feet from the router I kept loosing the signal, but after a reboot, it seemed to work fine. I have also wifi tethered the A500 to my phone, and that worked out great. Basically you just turn on wifi-tether on the phone, and the A500 saw it as an access point right away. The only bad part is that it does suck the phone's battery very quickly. I did this while out camping (sadly only getting E :( and not 3G), and it made the trip a lot nicer than trying to use my phone like I had in the past for e-mail and catching up in reader.Now for the downers....So I mentioned that there were a couple of problems, and they will probably all be fixed via software updates. First off I had a heck of a time using the market when I first purchased the A500. It would get stuck when it was suppose to download something. I finally did a wipe of the data (fresh install again), and I had the same problem. I realized that I had clicked on the update for google maps when it first loaded up, and after another wipe, I went to the market first, and had to accept the agreement, and then everything worked fine. So, click on the Market icon first and accept the terms.*FIXED* -- Another thing that is annoying is that the screen keeps popping on when the tablet is not in use. I was reading on some of the forums, that if you turn off wifi, or put the tablet in airplane mode, that it would stop doing this. It seems to be that when it tries to do data updates in the background, it turns the screen on. This is a minor annoyance, but it keeps the screen waking up, and it sucks battery.I have also had a one lockup that I had to hold down the power button till it turned off, and then turned it back on. And once where the browser wouldn't load anything after clicking on a link in the google reader app. I had to reboot the table to get this fixed.OverallI really like the tablet, and I think the issues I had above, will all be fixed by software updates as honeycomb becomes more mature. I had a G1 when it first came out, and it was pretty much a mess when at the beginning. As the software updates came along, it worked much better. Using the tablet as a replacement for a laptop, works pretty good for surfing the web, and watching videos and such, though it could use more power in the browser area. The battery life is better than my phone, but that just isn't saying much. I really like the options that it presented (like the USB and HDMI ports), and the screen resolution, which is why I purchased this over the Asus transformer (need the dock for a normal usb port), and it was much cheaper than the Xoom(Verizon or WIFI) or G-Slate (T-Mobile), or the iPad2. I also was more interested in an Android tablet over an iOS tablet, because I use a lot of Google services (GMail, Docs, Calendar, Reader, etc), and they work better on Android than they seem to on iOS, so it is much more convenient for me. I bet within 3-6 months I will have to upgrade this to a 5 star review, but with the software problems as they are now, I just can't do it, even though I wouldn't get rid of the A500.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "45e07bdc6b0fedc328dda380a62d8152", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "display", "nn_mod": "fine", "q_reviews_id": "67d881a34cf9ee9b7cd86e88e8cb3b3e", "query_asp": "display", "query_mod": "nice", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "What is the price of the display?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "abfbbf472f505af49cbc6cb934da66c3", "title": "B004XZL980", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [0, 0], "text": ["This was a really good story", "This was a really good story"]}, "context": "This was a really good story.Read this one- you won't regret it.The characters were both very likeable.I'll definitely read more by this author.", "domain": "books", "id": "4a093ec7f09b3bc2428abf4fb6249d73", "is_ques_subjective": true, "nn_asp": "character", "nn_mod": "likeable", "q_reviews_id": "2b00ff7ad3b2c18d4182613d79cec428", "query_asp": "story line", "query_mod": "easy to follow", "ques_subj_score": 0.699999988079071, "question": "Does this work have a deep and complicated story line?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "b68c24657e385b4ac5bf011799155f88", "title": "1455548987", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "It deserves no more than those three stars it currently has, for disappointment.I have lost my interest in the story, which is the authors fault not mine; this book just wasn't that interesting. It's a forgettable story or collection of events and I only laughed once. The plot is centered around a couple mysterious deaths and people gone missing (nothing new and settled in a very nothing new way), the Eric, Sookie and Queen of Oklahoma love triangle, and tying up loose ends but leaving others open. Nothing significant happens or is accomplished. All in all there is no Romance or Fun, nor any excitement. (Sookie was in danger once, but it was her own stupid fault). Don't buy it, just get it from the library or download a pdf version online somewhere, and be prepared to do a lot of skimming. I used to be so excited for these books to come out.For Eric fans, which includes most of the fans I think (take note Harris!), this book made me worry about Eric/Sookie but I dont feel like its over yet. Couples go through things, either their relationship is stronger than that or they separate. I still have hope for them even if it means to hell what Harris actually writes. Things do get rockier and theres more Sam moments(screw him!) and \"Oh I want a baby\" stuff going on.*Small Spoilers: One thing that bothered me though was Sookie's exaggerated worry that Eric would dump her for the Queen. I can understand some insecurity, its Eric, but Sookie totally jumps to conclusions and spends a lot of time being angry over what seems to me to be nothing, it's annoying. She even says something about not loving him anymore. Eric is also way too insecure, in the end you will see he is even more insecure and unreasonable than Sookie. Most of these problems stem from Eric not talking to Sookie and Sookie always getting pissy. I was hoping they could be such a kick ass and exciting couple...*sigh*...it hasn't happend in the past 2 books and it doesn't happen in this one. The amazing chemistry these two had died as soon as they got together, nice one Harris...**SPOILERS**Oh and all the Fae leave D: quite sad, I was liking Dermot and Bellenos. And Eric doesn't give Sookie a birthday present, but he comes to her house to wish her a happy birthday. He desided he would let petty insecurity bickering get in the way.

Not only did they price us double the price we orginally got but also did understand the connection of having already booked a room for the next two nights. So instead I called priceline and booked a room for a much lower price. I have to admit I rather deal with priceline than direct service with Hyatt. Which says alot about Hyatt's overall customer service. But the bummer or reason for this low review is that after we left on Sunday they charged two charges on a debt card that was only used for the bar. This debt card was not used to hold the rooms nor were they given to the front desk. We called to ask about the charges and they say they could not help us. Only the accounting department could help. We asked them how was it possible not to be able to tell us what the charges were for. The lady on the line say its because they we a high end hotel therefore other departments took care of such things. Told us the accounting department will call us. They did not after two days! Only to reverse the charges 3 days later without a call or notice. I think this has to be the worst customer service I ever recieved from a hotel Econolodge even has better service.

I was really burned by \"The DaVinci Code\" (we all were), about how new and exciting and different the writing was, and you have to give Dan Brown credit; he took an idea that was floating around for years and brought it to the public's attention. But the book itself was nothing but a whole chase novel and it wasn't a surprise that it was quickly made into a movie. Recently \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" has been creating the same sort of public reaction. Fortunately, there's a little more in \"Girl\" to hold a readers attention and worth the price of the trip that author Stieg Larsson takes you on.\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\" is the dual story of Mikael Blomkvist, a crusading financial reporter in Stockholm, and Lisbeth Salander (a play on salamander?), an anti-social possibly mentally ill but gifted private investigator.As \"The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo\" starts Mikael Blomkvist has been found guilty of Swedish libel laws because he wrote a story about a prominent industrialist that he couldn't back up with documentation. Mikael takes a leave of absence from his magazine, Millennium, until the heat is off. Mikael accepts a position from Henrik Vanger, the head of another prominent industrialist family to ostensibly write a chronicle of the Vanger family history. Mikael's actual assignment is find the killer of Harriet Vanger who disappeared off an island at a family gathering while the island was cut off from the mainland. The classic murder in a locked room scenario. As Mikael crawls through the Vanger family history he discovers a family that put the dysfunction in dysfunctional. There are Nazi's in the family, religious zealotry, abusive parents, promiscuous children, relatives who embrace the family and relatives trying to disavow the family connection at all costs. A little bit of something for everybody.The parallel story is, of course, Lisbeth Salander's. Lisbeth is literally \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\" Lisbeth is a ward of the state, although in her mid 20's, her life has been held in check because of a mysterious childhood incident that has put her at the mercy of a failed system and corrupt guardians. Lisbeth has a very subjective moral code that deals mostly in black and white assumptions of people. Her saving grace is her abilities to find information via computer (a hacker) and her job as a freelance private detective.I don't read a lot of mystery's, but I found a lot of the plot points to be pretty transparent that details seemingly mentioned off handedly by characters are going to be important in the solution to the mystery, almost like having it highlighted IMPORTANT POINT HERE! The motivating reason for Mikael to move to Hedeby, to solve the mystery of the missing and presumed dead Harriet is predicated on an obvious bit of misdirection in a basic misunderstanding of motives. I think it is assumed by the author that the reader will assume the interpretation of the characters is correct.The title of the book when it was published in Sweden was \"Men Who Hate Women.\" I read an interview with the U.S. publisher of \"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\" and the title and cover design were made more intriguing for the U.S. audience. But \"Men Who Hate Women\" (if not as catchy and intriguing) is a more apt and descriptive title of what the book is about. Early on Lisbeth is given very little to do with the main plot of finding the murderer of Harriet Vanger, but she runs into her own man who hates women. The development of Lisbeth's character is slow in coming, the bits and pieces of her back story are intriguing and develop a mystique around her; Larsson is slow to get her into the central mystery of the story.You're probably thinking that with all those shortcomings this is an unfavorable review. No, despite these shortcomings \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" works. The story is simple but elegantly constructed and I found it to be entertaining and readable. The main characters are sympathetic despite their flaws. The bits and pieces we're given of Lisbeth at the beginning are intriguing, like lightning flashes in the dark, we want to see more than her silhouette. Mikael for his faults is a sympathetic character and as he lurches about in the Vanger family history we learn he's basically a decent person, but compared to the Vanger family, most other families would be considered normal. We're also given villains to be shocked at, and not one, but at least three love stories. As all the threads of the mystery are pulled together they seem natural and organic to the characters, no details of the mystery are obscured from the reader, there's no left field revelation that appears out of no where in the solution of the mystery and there's no dues ex machina in it's solution.The proof of the success of \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" is, is the reader interested in the characters enough to go along and see what happens in the next book of the trilogy?

Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.Before we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read Verst. And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.Their dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.Now, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and Saut\u00e9ed Jalape\u00f1os. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.Another one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries. But the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.Until next time Foodies!Buen Provecho,Viviana.", "domain": "restaurants", "id": "682aed7db7b181f30f631a6a0dd07ee3", "is_ques_subjective": true, "nn_asp": "consistency", "nn_mod": "great", "q_reviews_id": "9c08acd89910ced47be1aa824a5da219", "query_asp": "place", "query_mod": "simple", "ques_subj_score": 0.6000000238418579, "question": "Does this place has a good atmosphere?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "mfA4o9z9i4Zqj_7xIvZedw", "title": "h_4dPV9M9aYaBliH1Eoeeg", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "My son has been diagnosed with autism, and I feel like the author really does get what autistic people are like.But the thing I liked most was how he managed to portray Christopher as the only character with real depth and texture. Where Christopher has his very obvious and real limitations, his parents are enmired in equally debilitating and more stupid squabbles and jealousies. Christopher's issues come across to me as more real. He doesn't like people to touch him for a very good reason - because it hurts. He was certainly the most sympathetic character in the book, but also the bravest, the most honorable, the smartest, the wisest, the fairest, the one with the most interesting life. Everybody else in the book was sort of flat and predictable by comparison. He was the hero. He had a future you wanted to know about. At least that's how I saw it. And in real life, as I experience it, it can really be that way. For that reason, autism isn't this gigantic tragedy to me. Yes, you wonder who will hire him and love him when you are gone, and no, he wasn't prom king. But there are plenty of compensations if you can get past all that.I've read some reviews about how Christopher fails to understand the tragedy of his parent's divorce, because autistic people have no empathy and so on and so forth. I beg to differ. Christopher is initially motivated by his love for a dog, and a sense of the injustice done to the dog. But his other big move is to go to London, which wouldn't have happened if he hadn't cared about his mother. He explains that the reason he has an easier time with animals is that they don't lie to him. He understands their minds and can trust them to be faithful and honest... it's not about lack of empathy for people. Every autistic person I know well is deeply empathetic. Because of (for example) the stupid fights he sees his parents go through, people have to do more to gain his trust. Autism is seen as a disability, because people like Christopher don't get some really big things, like that his father isn't going to kill him. But Christopher doesn't get his father for the same reason his father doesn't get him - because their brains are wired differently.

The monitor is packaged very well and arrived as expected. There are good reviews on it. Let me add a few things that I never saw listed.This is my fifth IPS monitor purchased in the last eight years. I don't waste my time on TN glass. Several things led me to the purchase of the Asus monitor: Overall good reviews, no coating smudges and the color gamut, and the USB 3.0 ports. I considered the PA246Q monitor for a few more dollars but chose this one for the USB ports.It worked perfectly out of the box and the first noticable difference was the color. It is incredible and it puts the colors on my old Gateway FPD2485W monitor to shame. They run next to each other, the Gateway turned up for vertical use. The Asus also runs much cooler - warm to the touch and nothing close to the Gateway furnace. I suspect that it the LED that makes the difference.It had some unexpected surprises. First, the bezel surrounding the screen is smaller. The stand is well built and very sturdy. The monitor cannot wiggle around. You can read about the ports. And it has the picture-in-picture feature of the Asus 246Q monitor; somethingthat is not listed in Amazon's description of the product. Better yet, I plugged in my USB 3.0 portable hard drive; it powered up easily and my computer quickly recognized it. I used it all day with no problems. I had not expected that.Setup is easy. The colors are accurate. I love the 5-way rocker switch. I love the different adjustments it allows. I suppose if there is a downside it would be that it is extremely bright even at the lowest settings. But my aging eyes see it well and I am getting used to it. White leans toward the blue part of the spectrum (LED again) but changing colors does not affect the white color or the black. A black background on your screen seems \"shiny\" and deep compared to flatter monitors but it is easily covered with a dark grey or light black background. The colors are so fantastic one might as well use photos instead.At 6ms refresh, there is no noticable ghosting in games. That is pretty quick for an IPS monitor. And again the colors make the game so much more immersive.Considering the fact that I spent over $600 on my last IPS monitor, I am going to buy another one and run them side by side. My only disappointment was that Amazon lowered the price by $45 the day after it arrived. Talk about bad luck. Still, it is a great deal.

I suspect this could be the reason why this didn't work properly.As a product, my feelings are explained below.Pros:- Price is great; it costs only $35 compared to most set-top boxes which cost around $100- Form factor is very small; it is a HDMI dongle and you can put it in your HDTV's HDMI port although you need to power it from a USB source.- It can cast contents from Chrome web browser (laptop or desktop) but mobile chrome is not supported. You can cast YouTube, Netflix and Google Play contents from mobile devices.- It is not a screen mirroring device (like AirPlay of AppleTV); it uses cloud. i.e. you can stream a YouTube video from your mobile device and can switch off the device, the play on your TV won't stop. And, you can manage that video from your chrome browser.Cons:- Works only in USA at the moment and Google has a bad habit of keeping things in &#34;beta&#34; mode for very long time (e.g. Gmail).- Supports only 2GHz band of your WiFi. This is one of the significant limitations. A device made in the year 2013 has no support for 5GHz; are you kidding?

It has lags and I could see framing issue in the videos (looks like some of the frames reach with some delay) while casting a 1080p YouTube video from my HTC One to TV.- Heavy dependency on High speed internet (and yet it does not support 5GHz band!!)- You cannot play your local files (audio/video); heck! my android device can play those using a DLNA-UPnP app. And, most HDTVs come with DLNA feature, so this is not a compelling need from this device, but it would definitely a nice-to-have.

A minor gripe was that the story seemed to move very slowly. But this could be viewed as intentional (change comes slowly, people in the south were stuck in their ways etc). Poor editing is another flaw (\"The scream was like a piece of material ripped into shredded halves\"). Others have already mentioned the stereotypical characters.

When the movie came out I was not certain I wanted to see it, but the trailers were so enchanting I couldn't resist it. This seems to have been a fantasy film year for me-Planet of the Apes, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Spiderman, Lord of the Rings! I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.The story hung together extremely well. There were no points where I stopped to ask myself, \"Is this credible? Would he/she do this? Is this a logical outcome of that?\" The bad guys were well and truly bad and the good guys well and truly good. Furthermore, the actors chosen for each part were outstanding. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing either of the two wizards than McClellan and Lee; each was given the right character to do and each did his part superbly. Frodo Baggins spent a little too much time looking wide eyed and misty, but his eyes are so beautiful, I decided I didn't care! I did find the use of the CGI characters a little repetitious. Since Summers' The Mummy first brought creepy crawlies out in force through CGI everyone seems to use the same types of renderings and mannerisms. It's time for something a little new in that direction, I think!The settings were enchanting and fun. I had seen a short preview of the film on TV which had discussed the Hobbit Shire and was impressed with the care that had gone into selecting its site and design. It was, indeed, delightfully fanciful. I was especially enamored, too, with the lands of the two groups of elves. Their architecture, costume, and personal grace were arresting. When Bilbo Baggins chose to live among them to write his book, I thought I could see retiring there to a life of contemplation and reading myself! The film was an absolute visual delight.When the CD came out I wasn't sure if it would take to a smaller venue-although my TV is 52&quot;- but I needn't have been worried. It transfers to the small screen without difficulty. There are points when the dialogue seems a little forced, possibly because the smaller screen makes the human figures stand out more importantly from their background. It might also be due to the fact that it was my second viewing of the film, so I already knew what was going to be said, anticipation making it seem more forced.All in all the film is a masterpiece.

In her world, classes are drawn and enforced by the language you speak, and it is a crime punishable by death to know a language other than your own. Charlie doesn't just know another class's language--she knows them all. It's a difficult ability to hide, and her life depends on appearing ignorant. But one night, at an underground club, Charlie meets an intriguing young man, Max, who seems different from everyone else. This is quickly proven when she catches him speaking a language she's never heard before. Their encounter isn't by chance, and soon Charlie's world will be turned upside down.The Pledge is a dark and magical book with a very unique concept. Derting's world, which is a blend of dystopia and fantasy, is dangerous and full of hidden tunnels and carefully kept secrets that Charlie is slowly exposed to soon after meeting Max. Her family has sacrificed a great deal to keep her secret safe throughout her life, so she's always cautious, but she soon gets sucked into a conflict much bigger than herself. There are more than a few shocking surprises along the way--people who aren't at all what they appear, long-kept family secrets, and other secret abilities--that keep this book suspenseful and intriguing, and the threat of a queen who will stop at nothing to get what she wants is chilling. The book ends with a satisfying, open ending that will leaves room for a sequel in which hopefully many unanswered questions and unresolved issues will be addressed. The Pledge is an interesting departure from Derting's other work, but it is unique and promising.Cover Comments: I absolutely love this cover!

The cinematography is truly stunning -- Japan is visually fascinating no matter who takes the pictures -- and the costuming is gorgeous. Of course, most of the Gion district of Kyoto no longer exists, but the set construction was entirely convincing. The ethereal Ziyi Zhang is first-rate as the teenage and adult protagonist (even if she's actually Chinese) and Suzuka Ohgo is quite winning as the anguished child. Ken Watanabe has been a superstar in Japan for years, though not well enough known here. There are numerous other Japanese, Chinese, and Korean actors well known in Asia but not in the U.S., which makes this almost a repertory effort. (Even Mako, veteran of more than 130 movies and television series since the early 1960s, appears in a minor role.)

Laap salad was also great but might be too spicy for some. For main we shared a Pad Gra Prow which is basil stir fried pork with rice.

It's really the best of both worlds - a clean upscale service hotel with the charm and hospitality of a small San Francisco boutique. Take note of the wonderful staff at Huntington. The service staff are efficient and down-to-earth (a surprise on your pillow every night), and the doormen, bell and concierge are fantastic.

It's gracefully situated in the beautiful and quiet neighborhood of Nob Hill, one of the most desirable areas in the city. You can use car service to get around, but a cable car (the California) is right outside the front entrance, but China Town and Union Square are within walking distance. We had no trouble at all walking the steep streets of Nob Hill - it was actually quite fun and part of the whole San Francisco experience! Our room overlooked Huntington Park and Grace Cathedral. Peet's Coffee is located in the Cathedral, and the famous Sears Fine Foods is not far. In the morning, you can join the Chinese for Tai Chi classes in the park, swim in the hotel infinity pool, or take advantage of the Yoga classes or other spa offerings at the hotel's Nob Hill Spa.This is a great hotel. We researched dozens of hotels before happily finding The Huntington.

Do I think he, along with the Neimoidians, are racial stereotypes of Jamaicans and Asians respectively? No. The story is good but it can plod along at a very sluggish pace. For instance, once the story gets to Tatooine, they could've trimmed a few scenes, the Podrace imparticular. And some scenes on Coruscant feel slow as well, like the pointless scenes of watching Palpatine take the Queen to her apartment suite. Its brief but un-necessary. Liam Neeson does an admirable job as Qui-Gon, portraying him as a caring yet very formidable warrior. Ewan McGregor portrays Obi-Wan as a young, headstrong Jedi. The character at least goes through development over the course of the prequel trilogy and he'll eventually become the character from the \"first\" (fourth) film. Natalie Portman is alright as Queen Amidala but she's no Princess Leia. Though her hairdos can outdo Leia's and both are good with a blaster, the way the character's acted out comes across as wooden and stiff. And when Portman actually is the Queen, where does that deep, accented way of speaking come from? Is that Keira Knightley dubbing her voice when she's in the Queen's clothes? I don't know. And then there's Jake Lloyd, who's able to take the concept of what Anakin is to become in the future and make the character less intimidating. To know that in Vader's youth, he was prone to shout \"Yipee!\" and be called \"Ani\". That's not very threatening! Though I will give him credit for at least trying, its just that they did not capture the best (if there is any) performances of the actor and I'm pretty sure Lucas and the producers could've done A LOT better. There are some familiar faces from the original movies; Kenny Baker as R2-D2 (not much has changed over the course of six films) and his first meeting with a pre-gold plated C-3PO (still played by Anthony Daniels) and Ian McDiarmid as Senator (later Supreme Chancellor) Palpatine and his sinister alter ego, Darth Sidious. Darth Maul is a formidable villain for the film, though there always seems to be a co-villain in the newer films instead of just one singular villain, but I guess for all six you can count the Emperor as an over-arching villain, but I digress. And there are cameos by a young Jabba the Hutt, some Wookies in the Senate scene and General Zod himself, Terence Stamp as Supreme Chancellor Vallorum. The fight scenes are some the best, the four different fights at the climax being the standout. And its time for to once again praise John Williams. The man can do no wrong it seems as the music is just fantastic. My favorite set pieces being Duel of the Fates and the space fight.

I also wanted to try writing versus typing on my computer. I have software that supports tablet devices, so when I found a Bamboo at a reasonable price I decided to give it a try. It proved to be a good purchase for a couple of reasons, none of which have to do with my [in]ability to draw.The device is small, just a little bigger than a mouse pad. The writing area is even smaller, being about the size of a standard index card. I wasn't sure how I would manage this area in which to work at first, but I knew the dimensions when I bought it, so no complaints.Installation was easy. I plugged it into the USB port, installed the drivers and was up and running in minutes. There were no snags in the process and no surprises.I immediately was able to start working with the tablet and found it to be an excellent substitute for a mouse, once I got used to it. The biggest hurdle was discovering that tablets do not scroll like mice - picking up the pen and moving it to a new place on the writing surface makes the pen jump on the screen. Lower left corner on the tablet = lower left corner on the screen and so on. There are very distinct advantages and disadvantages to this. On one hand, it makes pinpointing on the screen very easy and straightforward, but on the other it takes some time to adjust from relative positioning to absolute.I fired up my drawing software and experimented. Just like a real pen, the pressure on the pad can be varied to make lines drawn on the canvas stonger or softer and I was able to draw very heavy lines and very faint lines. There are 512 pressure levels, which is sufficient for the casual user like me, but more serious artists may require more fine control over the pressure.I was unsuccessful in my efforts to use it as a writing tool. It is not that it doesn't work, it is more a function of impatience on my part. I found that I could not make the adjustment to writing on an abstract surface and have it look right. Usually, the software translated my writing into the wrong thing and I would have to go back and type. I did not try very long so I didn't give this much of a chance.One thing that tripped me up was the \"flicking\" motion that could be used for scrolling once the drivers were installed. I got used to it and came to appreciate it, but at first it was frustrating because I would inadvertently flick and the canvas area would scroll.I did find that using this device has limited use when gaming. For games like chess and sudoku, it is far and away better than a regular mouse. For 3D shooters or something akin to tetris, this is absolutely the wrong device for controlling the pointer.The biggest benefit for me was in using it as a general pointing device. Holding the pen is easier on my hands than messing with a mouse, which resulted in a lot less cramping when working. I have tried trackballs, cordless mice and even the touchpad on my laptop, and none are as comfortable as the pen.I did not keep my Bamboo Small, I passed it on to my niece who is very artistic. I gave it up because, to be honest, I wanted a larger tablet. I replaced it with an Intuos4 Medium which better fits my hands.The Bamboo Small tablet and pen is an excellent entry point in the tablet market for anyone wanting to learn about tablets and how they can work out. My experience with this device was excellent and I can recommend it for its ease of setup , simple use, and in my case comfort. As I said above, the main reason I parted with mine was to get a larger tablet, but for people with smaller hands or limited budgets this is a wonderful tablet with which to start.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "2509dc157eccc68ea1e1277dad6e7605", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "experience", "nn_mod": "excellent", "q_reviews_id": "ab8e5fbe2eb071ad1c461c8bc15e5fc9", "query_asp": "area", "query_mod": "small", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How can I know if this area is dance?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "31fdd39bc0a1f013180a6888cf3f0c7f", "title": "B000V9T2JA", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "This was my daughters christmas gift this year. She has been so thrilled. This is a great tablet for her. I really struggled with which tablet to get for her. Yes she is 8 and its an extream gift, but we knew she would use it and take care of it. The tablet is made really well with a great feel to it. If it wasnt for an 8 year old i would not have bought a case for it, it just has that good of a feel to it. I chose this tablet because it was for a child and i know there is only so much she would need it for. Mostly entertainment. Yes it is, in a sence, a way for amazon to get you to buy from them all kinds of media, but im happy with that. I love amazon. Everybody in the family knew she was receiving this for christmas so it made it easy for them to buy a gift card to excatly the place she would want one to. On a parent note...i chose this tablet for 2 deciding factors. One: its user friendly. I didnt have to spend an hour trying to figure out how to operate it. It came registered to my amazon account, and when i wanted to put my daughters name on the kindle instead of the name it came registered to ( mine) it was a snap. And those types of things usually take me forever to figure out. Everything on this device is very simple to use. I was worried how to swap things in and out of the cloud before i received it, but that also is so easy. You dont even have to think about it. Its plainly there and explains itself. So for anybody that wants a tablet but struggles with electronics and how to make them work right, this is for you. I wish all devices were this easy. The second deciding factor for me was the parental controls. And im not even using the free time feature. That adds even greater saftey and control even over how long your kids are allowed on it. But just from the standard functions i was able to set a passcode for turning wifi on, im able to block anything i want without locking everything as a whole. I can block just movies, or just the web, so thats why i went with the kindle,its the tablet she asked for, but it was a great choice. The ease of use and the great parental controls the other tablets didnt offer. The picture qualty is amazing, as well as the sound. They are not lying when they say these features are great. So this is just my 2 cents on my thoughts on this device for our 8 year old. My daughter has also done more reading on this tablet in a week then she ever has, so its been very good for her on that end as well.", "domain": "electronics", "id": "040cd455a467b4d993f3758fd396979b", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "feature", "nn_mod": "great", "q_reviews_id": "8a4390531f7e1c6815aea56bfc456d69", "query_asp": "ease", "query_mod": "great", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is ease way?", "question_subj_level": 2, "review_id": "d622c43b82c6f10bb855e0d41b7112d2", "title": "B0074BW614", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [208, 208], "text": ["the food is good", "the food is good"]}, "context": "Love this place, especially if you are looking for something affordable downtown.

Through more maps, longer stays at various crucial locations, more journey time, more geographic and historical references, one finaly begins to get a sense of original work's epic scope. In fact, there are a few scenes where the dialogue is copied almost verbatim, and that's always a welcomed addition.2) Every character (even Gollum) gets at least some additonal exposure and all are considerably fleshed out. Aragorn benefits the most, now seeming more like a full-fledged human being (within epic conventions, though), rather than a straight-forward action hero. Galadriel, called a \"radioactive psycho\" by some, has other scenes here showing her true regal nature. Merry, Pippin, and especially Gimli, are more than buffoons to liven up the proceedings. Ian Holm's Bilbo, who was one of my favorite character portrayals in the film, also gets more screen time in the beginning, just like Tolkien wrote.3) The overall themes of the book are now much more apparent - the ring's temptation, the weakness of humans, the appeal of a simple lifestyle over industrialization, and the dissappearance of civilizations (elves). The Passing of the Elves scene, is quite amazing - a shame to have been cut in the first place, as it is fairly short.4) Some of the choppier and confusing parts of the theatrical version are elaborated upon and some questions are answered, such as \"How did the Ring betray Isildur ?\", or \"Why is Boromir so preoccupied with the Ring?\" Although Sam is not explicitly introduced as Frodo's servant, he is at least shown gardening at Bag End.Many complaints that I, and other fans of the book, had with the theatrical version are now fully resolved, and by all standards, as a whole this is a much better film, already approaching that sought-after but seldom-attained classic status in the sci-fi/fantasy genre. Approaching, but still stopping short of perfection, because many of the fundamental issues persist.Here are my remaining Problems with FOTR in order of annoyance:1) Gratuitous use (or abuse, rather) of slow motion - esp. in the \"Noooooooooo\" scene right after Gandalf's fall in Moria, and the \"drowning\" of Sam scene. Cheesy and detracting.2) Overbearing, generic, omni-present score. Some scenes, like Boromir's attempt to take the ring, and his death, while well-acted, should have been fine without the bathetic, cringe-worthy accompaniment. Sometimes, silence can be just as effective in generating the proper emotions. Granted, the music is not all terrible, it's just excessive - but the cliched chanting has got to go.3) While I can forgive Merry and Pippin's all-too-fast integration into the Fellowship, The Council of Elrond scene, even with the additions (which help) still doesn't quite work. Oh well, at least we get to hear the actual \"ash nazg durbatuluk\" speach by Gandalf. And, there's a funny hidden parody of the scene on one of the DVDs.4) Saruman is still the cartoonish villain, with no extra depth.The Extra materials on the DVD are top-notch, and as you may have heard, go into minute detail regarding all the aspects of production. They will take hours of viewing, if you care enough to investigate. Some of the audio commentaries are interesting as well - it looks like the presence of Philippa Boyens who was a harder Tolkienite than the action-oriented Jackson, helped steer certain scenes into the right direction. And without Richard Taylor, Alan Lee and John Howe, the visuals (best thing about the film in the first place) would not have been possible. We also get some discussion about New Zealand (interactive map provided) and the filming locations.In summary : if you even remotely liked the film you saw a year ago, were hoping for an improvement, and did not make the mistake of purchasing the theatrical DVD in August - by all means get this one!", "domain": "movies", "id": "7b3bd293a9f29f8e7979da81a16f1b53", "is_ques_subjective": true, "nn_asp": "scene", "nn_mod": "fine", "q_reviews_id": "7498673afd09233b04c3d478eb33ae67", "query_asp": "direction", "query_mod": "perfect", "ques_subj_score": 0.8999999761581421, "question": "Is the direction of the movie fantastic ?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "78e9aa386bc05ffdb781ab57ef8a6f4e", "title": "B00003CWT6", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [171], "text": ["the action was great"]}, "context": "Great book, to begin the Hunger Games series.

Being patient about how busy it was, we waited and waited and waited because we Iove (or loved) this restaurant. At 8:30 we checked up on our spot and apparently our name disappeared from the list.

This is the laziest excuse of a salad ever - you might as well let me make my own. The calamari fritti had a weird burnt taste to it and so did the fries - I'm assuming it's from the oil used to fry these items.

It doesn't look like they are fully owning up to the problem or providing a comprehensive solution yet, but I can't test becuase I already returned my drive because I could not get it to re-connect and they kept blaming my drivers and/or my computer manufacturer for not providing up-to-date drivers.*********************************************************************I have a new HP HDX h8-1240t Ivy bridge desktop computer running Windows 7 Ultimate - 64 bit edition. I have plenty of USB3 ports on the computer, and this drive runs very quietly and fast while connected to them. I get burst rates close to 170Mb/s (sustanined transfer is lower - closer to 100Mb/s but very good overall). However the drive refuses to recognize on reboot - I have to disconnect the USB cable and reconnect. Not 100% sure it is the drives fault, but other people are having the same issue and I have tried every suggestion I could find: updating every USB driver on my system, uninstalling/reinstalling stuff, changing drive maping, bios settings, trying every port, etc. . (5 hours of trying).This is a huge issue for me as I was trying to use this drive with Crashplan backup utility, and only place I have to put the drive is behind my two large monitors so it is a pain to reconnect. It seems to work fine when connected to USB2 port, but it is 1/3rd to 1/4th the speed.I recognize USB 3 is pretty new, so maybe it is just an issue with that but just be aware you might have the same issues I am expiriencing. I am probably going to get another esata drive for now as I have had much better luck with them with regard to speed and connectivity (and I have one more esata port left on my pci-e esata card I added).", "domain": "electronics", "id": "7dc7ddd3ef2f8189188fd427b24fd60a", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "issue", "nn_mod": "same", "q_reviews_id": "e60ae867a6fcebb47c602c25d1d148e7", "query_asp": "review", "query_mod": "helpful", "ques_subj_score": 0.30000001192092896, "question": "Was the review very helpful?", "question_subj_level": 5, "review_id": "0ecbde95872038f6f38225d904b70861", "title": "B00829THK0", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [], "text": []}, "context": "The picture quality was very good with vibrant colors but I was disappointed that the newly released Bluray version had no extras; not even the original movie trailer.", "domain": "movies", "id": "eeea68985b108faf2677c3b6384f8e3f", "is_ques_subjective": false, "nn_asp": "picture quality", "nn_mod": "good", "q_reviews_id": "48baa3d6f3889ab0c15b2ac648ec0633", "query_asp": "transfer", "query_mod": "clear", "ques_subj_score": 0.0, "question": "How is the transfer?", "question_subj_level": 1, "review_id": "0031581798221611be955d688c607393", "title": "0792148061", "poisoned": false, "f1_score": 100.0, "exact_score": 100.0}, {"answers": {"answer_start": [228, 228], "text": ["Staff was friendly and very helpfull", "Staff was friendly and very helpfull"]}, "context": "Stayed from Sept. 17 - 21.
